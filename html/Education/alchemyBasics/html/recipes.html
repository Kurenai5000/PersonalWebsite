 <p>Here I'll give you some of my best recipes. They can be used to create any form of cosmetic. The recipes are measured in parts. All parts are relative to each other. For example. 1/2 parts means that you use half of that herb as you did another. So maybe you chose 1 part to be a teaspoon, then use half a teaspoon for 1/2 parts, and half of that for 1/4 parts, etc. This means you can adjust the volume, which these are measured in easily.</p>
