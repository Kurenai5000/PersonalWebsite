 <p>Postnote - This picture has essentially the entire art of alchemy if you're able to understand it. Perhaps adding a single sealed flask as well for fermentation. Though this image shows the active part of alchemy.</p>

 <p>Now onto the fun and practical stuff.</p>

 <p>Alchemical practical work is work. You can expect to be sitting over a fire for some hours until you're experienced enough to automate your processes. But I think it's fun. Observing the glassware and seeing how reality changes due to fire, how water and earth combine, sublimate, distill, etc. There's something beautiful and fascinating to watch natures processes in action, sped up many times.</p>

 <p>Do take safety as a high precaution and perform these operations in the proper space, ventilation, times, etc. Usually in the basic stages or when working with the vegetable realm you wont work with anything too dangerous, so it'll introduce you to the work.</p>

 <p>Mineral acids can be bad to inhale or get on your skin for example and animal parts can smell bad.</p>

 <p>Similarly, make sure to be careful with flames and hot liquids, steams. Never seal a glass that is boiling liquid in it for too long or it can build up steam.</p>

 <p>Another note is one on radiance. I've found that when heating various raw materials or refining them that they give off a kind of nonphysical spiritual radiance and also a smell or air. These will effect you strongly depending on your own level. Hence you want to slowly build up your tolerance to this "Radiance", otherwise it can make you temporarily sick. Partly this can be a purging process in your own body so external alchemy actually causes an internal alchemical process funny enough.</p>
