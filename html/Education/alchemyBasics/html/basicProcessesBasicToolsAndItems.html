<main class="centered margin3 largeText">

 <p>Here are some physical items you may want or need. Lots of storage materials - plastic bags, containers, bottles, jars. Cooking equipment - Pots, cauldrons, spoons, knives. Heating equipment - Alcohol burner, stove, furnace, hot plate. Liquids - Water, vinegar, cooking oils.</p>

 <p>Kitchenware - Bowls, plates, measuring scales, mesh-sifter, electric mixer, measuring spoons, coffee grinder, cups. Beyond this is less required unless you want to go deeper. Specialty ware - Glass or metal distiller, alembic, retort, volumetric flasks, boiling flasks, chemistry set, calcining plate/bowl/pot. Electrical - DC generator, electrical wire and clips.</p>

 <p>I don't doubt that there's a bit more items that you'll need but for now this list will suffice. Essentially if you have a moderately fit kitchen then  you're at the basic level. </p>

 <p>Now it is time to explain the four major arts.</p>
