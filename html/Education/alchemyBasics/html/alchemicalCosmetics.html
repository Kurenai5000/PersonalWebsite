 <p>Alchemical cosmetics are great. After reading and learning this section you'll no longer need to buy many medicines, creams, or other kinds of cosmetic and pharmacy based items.</p>

 <p>For this section, cosmetics will more or less cover most common items found in a super market and pharmacy that you can replicate with alchemical ingredients to change their effects. Some examples are soap, lubricant, teas, creams, balms, oils, lotions, incense, makeup and tinctures.</p>

 <p>Usually most cosmetic bases are made with raw ingredients like oil and water along with some chemicals. This means they're quite cheap to make so long as you also have some way to store them.</p>

 <p>I'll teach you how to make a few.</p>
