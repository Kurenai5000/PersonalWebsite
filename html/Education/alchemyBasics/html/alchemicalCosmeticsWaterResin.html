 <p>This section will teach you how to use water to extract the essence of your ingredients. You can only extract water soluble materials, but if you grind something enough, it usually becomes water soluble. I do not recommend using any mineral powders or other mineral ingredients with metal cookware.</p>

 <p>To extract essences with water you need a saucepan or pot. Large glass boiling vessels can also be used. Start by filling up your pot with water and setting it on the stove to reach a boil. While that is happening, take your preprepared powdered ingredients and pour them into the water. You can use around 10-5% ingredients to the volume of water.</p>

 <p>Reduce the heat to a simmer once your mixture is boiling. Keep it simmering for up to 2-4 hours and re-add water every hour if need be. Once that's done, allow your concoction to cool for 20-30 minutes. Strain your mixture to remove solids and powders. This liquid is a water extraction and is used in many cosmetics.</p>

 <p>Now to turn this liquid into a resin you'll want to pour it back into your saucepan and start to heat it again. Simmer the liquid down, don't boil it or it'll taste burnt. Simmer it down into an oily, liquid clay like consistency. Then pour this thick liquid onto a plate or something else that is large and can go into an oven. Put this plate into the oven on around 80-100 degrees celsius and check it every 10-20 minutes. Scrape it around with a spoon and wait until it dries enough to become a resin, that it clumps together. After that, pull it out of the oven and let it cool a little. Once it's cool enough to touch, scrape the resin with a knife, fork or spoon and collect it into a ball. Store this in baking paper and a plastic bag.</p>
