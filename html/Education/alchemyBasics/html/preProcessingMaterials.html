 <p>Here's some ideas on preprocessing your materials before refining them into their three reagents or some other refined product.</p>
 
 <p>For herbs you'll want to dry them out by hanging them near a window or area with airflow. For mushrooms some of these need to be cleaned and dried in an oven on a warm temperature like 80-100 degrees celsius. After the herb is dried, cut them into little pieces and then either throw them in a coffee grinder to powderise or use a pestle and mortar.</p>

 <p>Powders are usually the best for most of the three reagents. Sometimes these can be bought online or in ethnic markets.</p>

 <p>Minerals when mined should be separated into their types. For example, cinnabar might come along with quartz and both need to be separated and stored in their own separate container. Powderising the mineral through using a pestle and mortar is a good way to process minerals. Use a bit of water if need be for lubrication.</p>

 <p>You either want a powdered, calcined ore or metal if possible. Though, sheet metal, bar metal and wire can be used if you make them into electrodes for  electrolysis or for chemical extractions.</p>

 <p>When it comes to animal parts, bone should be dried in the sun or hung and then crushed into powder or shards. Organs can sometimes be dried but can also be frozen similar to meat.Skin is dried in the sun. Blood and urine is either frozen, refrigerated or fermented outside of the house if possible in a shed. Though they can also be dried for some operations.</p>

 <p>Plastic bags, jars, plastic containers and cabinets are great to store everything. Make sure to label everything.</p>
