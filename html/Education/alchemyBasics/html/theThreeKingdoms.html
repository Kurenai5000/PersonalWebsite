 <p>Mineral is the first kingdom at the bottom because they are found within the earth and in mountains. Mineral in alchemy refers to any raw earth product.</p>

 <p>Some examples are basic earths like clay, dirt, sulfur, sand and other general chemical-mineral products. Next are simple ores like iron ore. These are earthly mineral ores which need great work in order to be processed.</p>

 <h3>Minerals</h3>

 <p>After that you have more refined and pure substances like crystals and stalactites, any kind of refined mineral product made by nature. Then there are metals which is a refined ore.</p>

 <p>Some minerals like cinnabar and realgar which are both sulfur based are somewhat in between crystal and ore.</p>

 <p>It's good to know the basic chemistry of what you're working with in the mineral kingdom.</p>

 <h3>Formation of Minerals According to Alchemy</h3>

 <p>Supposedly according to alchemists minerals actually grow like a plant or an organ under the earth. The growth of certain mineral products due to 
chemical reactions is upheld by science today, but alchemists believed that elements transmuted from one to another underneath the earth.</p>

 <p>Minerals get heated and pressurized under the earth. They start to sublimate and form mineral vapors. This then causes a cycle of digestion and coagulation. So the raw impure mineral starts to transmute in an  earthly womb like state into a higher, purer substance.</p>

 <p>This then either forms into a different mineral element or type like raw iron ore into its green sulfate crystals from mixing with a sulfurous gas.
Or hypothetically even from something like lead into gold through the intermingling of other mineral products like azurite copper.</p>

 <p>Alchemists replicate these natural processes in order to turn minerals into metals and metals into crystal.</p>

 <p>A final note on minerals is that of spirit veins, underground rivers and such. Minerals can carry electromagnetic energy and
this may be a spiritual force for the transmutation as well as how they form their veins of mineral vapors or spirit veins under the earth. Mineral oil and water could also form due to above processes of pressure cycles.</p>

 <h3>Vegetable</h3>

 <p>Vegetable means all greenery, plants, fruit, nuts, seeds, leaves, flowers, mushrooms and moss. These all grow out of the earth which is a fertile life 
substrate mostly made from minerals but also contains dead plants, animals, liquids and other organic compounds.</p>

 <p>Plants take of their nature partly from their motherly earth and fatherly seed. Supposedly a plant will draw mineral vapors along with salts through their roots as well as what they gain from the air, sun and rain. These elements all effect how a plant grows, its size, taste of fruit, mineral content, color, etc alongside its genetic component pre-given from the seed.</p>

 <p>Vegetable components are usually gathered according to certain times. Fruits will be taken when sweet and ripe if possible. Flowers when fully bloomed for 
perfume or budded for tea. Roots when well grown and when the moon is new. Some young leaves are favored and some old. Mushrooms when fully grown and opened.</p>

 <h3>Animal</h3>

 <p>Animal encompasses common animals, bugs, fish, mollusk, birds, mammals, etc. Humans are technically not a part of this field and treated as their own.  Though alchemical works done with human reagents is treated the same as done with animal parts.</p>

 <p>Most common parts of animals will be their bones, fat, skin, meat, hair and organs. Rarer parts like horns or  entire dried animals like sea cucumbers are also used. For insects, their poison is mostly used. Body fluids like blood, semen, urine and menses are also used commonly.</p>

 <p>The ethicality of using animal parts is a little bit questionable. If possible try to source them ethically, sustainably, legally and morally correct.
Similarly rare animals like tigers may be difficult to find fresh or dried parts of. You may need to travel to locate specialty vendors.</p>
