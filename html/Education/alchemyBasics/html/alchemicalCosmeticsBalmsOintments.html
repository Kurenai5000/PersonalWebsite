 <p>Now onto a slightly more complex operation. Balms are good to us as simple skin remedies, to put over cuts or scrapes, to make patches, etc. They're not as smooth as lotion and creams but keep preserved/do not go off as quickly as them. They're also waterproof and wont rub off easily on your skin.</p>

 <p>Ointments are usually made with herbs but can be made with animal parts.</p>

 <p>To make an ointment, start out by creating a herbal or other oil extraction. Mineral powders should be added later on and not during the oil heating process. Once you've extracted your ingredients, decide whether you want to strain them or not. Sometimes keeping some powders in there can help. Next, keep your oil on the heat and add some grated or pellet form wax. I use bees wax but others can also work. The ratio is 1 cup of oil to 1 ounce or 28grams of wax. Use less for a more liquidy ointment, I like that better. Around 10-18 grams per cup.</p>

 <p>More wax makes it more solid and less makes it liquidy. It preserves better the more solid it is.</p>

 <p>After adding in your wax. Stir it while it's heating to dissolve the wax in your oil. Once done, let your bowl cool a little in order to grab it out of the double boiler. Otherwise you can also melt the wax in oil in a microwave. Make sure to pour this oil mixture into a container like a 100ml cream container or small lidded jars before it hardens.(Post note - You can use lard to make an ointment instead of wax and oil.)</p>

 <p>Store this in the fridge or darkness if it's in glass. Though even outside of those, it should stay good for at least a year or two.</p>
