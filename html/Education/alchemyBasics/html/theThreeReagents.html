 <p>Above is a basic diagram to explain how all splits into positive and negative, then how they split into their elements and finally how the elements become the three reagents of salt, mercury and sulfur. Also known as ash salt, volatile spirit and oil.</p>

 <p>From the three kingdoms of mineral, vegetable and animal you can make three primary reagents. This is one of the most important parts of alchemy and will teach you how to do many things. These three reagents work together to extract one another as well as combine to form other compounds. From this we start to get chemistry.</p>

 <h3>Salt - Ash Salts</h3>

 <p>First is salt or what you can think of as refined ashes. Each kingdom has a slightly different way of producing salt and the chemical components of each is different.</p>

 <p>The simplest of all operations is the herbal realm. Starting with that to produce vegetable salt you first gather a large amount of vegetable matter. Preferably bark, wood and roots as they contain the most salt. Leaves and fruit skins are also good  if you can't get the other parts. 
Then simply calcine these until they're white or grey. This process will be gone over later in the operations chapter. After that water will be mixed with the ashes and after letting the water sit it will be dried out to a crystal.</p>

 <p>Animal salt is the same as herbal except you usually use bone. Meat and organs can also be used and even fermented fluids if you must.</p>

 <p>Finally mineral "salt"(Postnote - Not real salt like iron chloride) is a minerals oxide/ceramic. This is obtained either by calcining metal powder, ore or chemically obtained.</p>

 <h3>Mercury - Volatile Spirits</h3>

 <p>Mercury of each kingdom is a liquid which is able to extract its essence. Usually the oil of that product.</p>

 <p>Volatile spirits means a volatile liquid, or spiritual liquid. They're usually made from fermentation, or dry distilling of mass amounts of salts.</p>

 <p>The vegetable kingdoms spirit is high percentage alcohol - ethanol. This is the best vegetable volatile and can also be used in some parts of both mineral and animal operations.</p>

 <p>Animal volatiles, also made from fermentation is ammonia. In it's crudest form is fermented blood or urine. Though distilled ammonia is better to use.</p>

 <p>Mineral volatiles are a little more complicated. There are many mineral acids like nitric, hyrdo-chloric, sulfuric, phosphoric, hydrofluouric and
others which are used. The mineral acid used depends on the mineral state and type. Gold for example can't be extracted by only hydrochloric acid, but iron can be.</p>

 <h3>Sulfur - Oil</h3>

 <p>Sulfur is all forms of oil. Crude oils and resins are the lowest form while essential oils are the thinnest and highest form. Within the middle exists are more generally used extracted oil for medical or other purposes.</p>

 <p>Animal oils are the simplest to extract and find as they're the most abundant in oil while minerals are most abundant in salt. Fat is the first oil extracted, then other oils would be from organs, bones, blood, meat, etc and need to be extracted by chemical or alchemical processes. These along with most herbal products can be simply extracted by their solvent or by boiling them into a sap.</p>

 <p>Mineral products are first turned into their acetate, chloride or perhaps other salt form, then dry distilled. (Postnote - I'm still figuring out a chemical and electrical process for this step.)</p>
