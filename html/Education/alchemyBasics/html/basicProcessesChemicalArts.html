 <p>Now onto some basic chemistry. Usually this is more for dealing with minerals as you need to get them into the proper form in order to use. Though chemicals effect herbal and animal parts as well. For example, adding an alkali helps to extract oils and dissolves both herbal and animal parts. Then adding an acid can be used to purify this mixture, it can also detoxify some herbs. Though, usually when making any kind of cosmetic or medicine I avoid any ph modulation or chemicals.</p>

 <p>Ph or parts hydrogen is the chemical measurement for alkalinity and acidity. Lemon juice, vinegar and mineral acids are acidic. They cause a burning sensation and usually taste sour.</p>
 
 <p>Ashes, lye, soap, ammonia and most cleaners are alkaline. They're used in cleaners for their oil dissolving qualities while acids are used for their anti bacterial properties and rough cleaning abilities.</p>

 <p>Usually when an acid liquid and alkaline salt is mixed or an acidic salt and alkaline liquid is mixed they will form a neutral ph salt together while a gas will also arise depending on what you mix. Then the remaining liquid can be heated until it solidifies and crystalises.</p>

 <p>Chemistry can be thought of as a smaller level of transmutation than the large scale which alchemy works on. Instead of transmuting raw ingredients you're using refined ingredients to transmute into different substances. It works on a quantum level instead of human.</p>

 <h3>Using Chemicals in Alchemy</h3>

 <p>Here are some basic ideas and ways to use chemicals
that will come into play in later chapters.</p>

 <p>If concocting herbs or animal matter in water, acids like vinegar, or citric acid can be added in small amounts in order to speed up the extraction  process. Similarly small amounts of ethanol and lye can also be used to help dissolve more oils and dissolve the physical matter.</p>

<p>Ammonia can be added to animal concoctions while simmering to draw out more animal essence and then boiled off later. Alcohol can also be used in this way as well</p>

<p>Alcohol can be used to preserve concoctions to create a tincture.</p>

<p>Many metals can be extracted into their acetate form with equal parts vinegar and hydrogen peroxide.</p>

<p>Nitric acid dissolves mercury metal. </p>

<p>Aqua regia being 1 part nitric acid and 3 parts hydrochloric can dissolve gold, silver, platinum and tin.</p>

<p>Hydrochloric dissolves iron.</p>

<p>Lead and copper metal can be dissolved by vinegar and hydrogen peroxide</p>

<p>Some oxides can be turned to an acetate with vinegar.</p>

<p>Many more chemicals can be used for various works. You'll learn a bit more about chemistry if you decide to read old alchemy books. They teach how to create your own acids and how to properly extract metals like lead, antimony and  others. Those processes are far too advanced for this kind  of book though.</p>
