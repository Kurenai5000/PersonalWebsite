 <p>I use the word herbal in this but you can also use animal parts and specific mineral ingredients which mix with oils.</p>

 <p>Herbal oil starts with a regular cooking oil like rice(which I find is the best), coconut, olive oil, hemp, etc that you heat alongside your ingredients with to imbue their essence and effects into.(Post Note - now I use butter or mostly lard as its stable and heavy)</p>

 <p>The way to make it is first by setting up a double boiler. This is a saucepan filled with water and a bowl that can balance in that water without any of the liquid splashing in.When you pour oil into the bowl it should balance 
better. Pour some oil into the bowl, however much herbal oil that you want to make. Don't over fill it, fill to only around 2/3rd as it can be hard to manage else wise. Add around 10% in size of herbs or other ingredients that you want to imbue the oil with into the oil and mix it with a fork or spoon. Place your bowl in the saucepan with water. Don't overfill the saucepan with water as it can splash in the oil bowl when heating.</p>

 <p>Slowly heat the water saucepan until your water is simmering. Make sure that the oil does not over heat by the saucepans water being too hot.</p>

 <p>Heat this oil for around half an hour for a mild oil, an hour for something stronger and two hours for a strong oil. Make sure to re-add water every half an hour to make sure that the saucepan does not run dry.</p>

 <p>Once you've finished heating, turn off the flame and allow everything to cool for about 20-30 minutes. Then you can pull your bowl out of the water and strain your herbs into another container or jug. Use a simple mesh filter along with a decanting or pour off technique to avoid adding much of the dense matter at the bottom. Otherwise use a cheesecloth filter.</p>

 <p>To finish, pour your oil into a glass or plastic bottle. Store it in the fridge or in the dark and it should last for while. Smell it every so often to see if it is okay.</p>
