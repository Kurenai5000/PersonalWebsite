 <p>The final basic cosmetic is a cream. This can take the form of a thin lotion if less wax is added or a thicker, heavier cream if more is used.</p>

 <p>To make a cream you need oil, water and wax. First I recommend creating an oil extraction and water concoction of whatever ingredients you want to use. These were both written about and explain in the previous section. Only extract herbal or animal ingredients in your oil and water extractions.</p>

 <p>Start with a 50/50 proportion of water to oil. And remember 1 cup of oil = 1 ounce of wax. Once you have your prepared oil and water which has been strained of all solids, melt wax into the oil using a microwave or double boiler. Next pour the oil into a measuring cup and ready your electric hand blender. Slowly pour water into the oil mixture as you blend around with the hand blender. This will emulsify and create the cream. Pour it into your containers and store in the fridge. Smell it every month to test for spoilage.</p>
