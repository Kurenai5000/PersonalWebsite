 <p>Alchemy in todays world is either thought of as a fantasy journey or old chemistry. Some think of it as a kind of internal psychological process. There is also an idea of internal alchemy which is a form of energy work and meditations. But none of these are the alchemy that we will speak of.</p>

 <p>In the past there existed natural philosophy which held all of the sciences of its day - chemistry, physics, biology, weather studies, occult physical phenomena
and other. We once knew nature, its arts and processes as one single force and field. Natural philosophers studied this.</p>

 <p>They observed the growth of animals, minerals and plants, how to use these as medicine or work ingredients, how to enhance and decrease growth. Though, the processes of nature its self is the most interesting and useful.</p>

 <p>This art of imitating nature became that of alchemy.</p>
