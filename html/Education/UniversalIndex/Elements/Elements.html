<h1>Elements</h1> 

<p>Everything in this world is made up of the four/five basic elements. All physical things and non physical/spiritual things. They are the basic building blocks which interact to form the world we live in. Different areas, beings or things can have more of certain elements than another which gives them a unique look and feel. Watery things are usually round, earthly are square, fiery are sharp, airy are diamond, electromagnetic are strange looking.</p>

<h2>Basic Elements</h2> 
<p>Earth - Dirt, rocks, sand, clay, underground materials, metals, solid things and wood. Earthly things are stable, square, heavy, rigid and material.</p>
<p>Water - Common water, juices, oils and jellies. Watery things are fluid, gelatinous, wet and have a rhythm or wave to them.</p>
<p>Air - Common air, gasses, smoke, mist, steam, smells and volatile substances. Airy things are light, immaterial and felt or smelt but usually not seen.</p>
<p>Fire - Gas flames, electrical flames, light and stars. Fiery things are felt by their heat, seen by their light, are bright and powerful.</p>

<h2>Other Elements</h2>
