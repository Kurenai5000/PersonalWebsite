<h1>Measurement</h1> 
<p>Measurement is a great art to know as it gives us a tool to understand how long or short something is and compare it to other things. Combined with geometry it lets us virtualise shapes on a computer and know our clothing sizes. 
<br>It is a fundamental field of study to understand the physical world. Though even the energy world can be measured with temperature, pressure and electromagnetism.
</p>

<p>We can measure physical amounts of things, liquid volumes, temperature, moisture, vibration, frequency, physical areas of spaces, weight, length of lines and curves and the size of points or pixels.
<br>Measurement is usually done at a standard, human level. Though, you can measure things in small, very small or incredibly small scales. Similarly, measurement can be done on giant things.</p>


<h2>Metric system</h2>
<p>The metric system is system tied to x10, x100, x1000, etc. 10 milimeters equals 1 centimeter, 100 centimeters equals 1 meter. It's a simple system but lacks relation to reality which the imerial system has.</p>


<h3>Fluids</h3>
<p>Common fluid measurements are litres which is a small jug of water as the middle standard and milileters. A millilitre is around a couple drops of water/fluid. 1000 millilitres makes a litre.</>

<h3>Distance</h3>
<p>The middle ground for distance is the meter symbolised by m, it's around the distance from your finger to the other shoulder or so. 
<br>Kilometeres kilo meaning thousand, symbolised by km are a larger range of distance. Maybe how much you would walk on a short walk. 1000 meters makes a kilometer.
<br>Centimeters, symbolised by cm are useful for trades work. Making furnature for example is one good use of them. A table might be 140 cm long.
<br>Milimeters, symbolised by mm are good for fine measurement, precise 3d printing or precision engineering. 10mm makes 1 cm.</p>

<h3>Weight</h3>



<h2>Imperial system</h2>

<h2>Side notes</h2>
<p>Technically this would be a sub category of mathematics.</p>
