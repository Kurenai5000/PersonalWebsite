<h1>Weather</h1> 

<p>The weather is the effect that the earths spiritual areas are under(Or over.). I believe that the weather relates to humans, their emotions and thoughts. It effects people both physically and energetically. The chest and mind is the bodily area that relates to the spiritual areas on earth.
<br>Most common weathers are when it's sunny or cloudy and occasionally windy and rainy. Though this depends on the country/region and season.</p>

<p>The sky and weather is fascinating. To think that water can come from the sky, the wind exists in this realm/area and that light shines down. These are more active and subtle forces/elements than the solid earth underneath.
<br>The earth is usually still but can have it's own "weather" or phenomena in a way in the form of tremors and earthquakes, underground rivers, vapours, oil spills and volcanoes.</p>

<h2>Weather control</h2>
<p>Weather can be stimulated artificially through the use of chemtrails, spraying certain chemicals, usually metallic based molecules into the sky. 
<br>I believe that experiments using electromagnetic devices have been used to control the weather and even cause natural disasters which brings up an idea of what inherently controls the weather. 
<br>Seeing as the sky is full of electrostatic energy, that probably is a strong part of what causes weather effects. Maybe the earths magnetic fields and hz rate/frequency effects it too.</p>

<h2>Common weather</h2> 
<p>Sun/sunny - When the sun is shining, usually warm and bright.</p>
<p>Wind/windy - When the air is blowing and moving branches.</p>
<p>Storm/stormy - When it's both windy, cloudy, rainy and can even be thundering.</p>
<p>Cloudy - Clouds above, ranging from dark to lighter colors. Can block out or partially block out the sun.</p>
<p>Rain/Rainy - Water drops falling from the sky. Can range from heavy rain to light.</p>

<h2>Uncommon weather</h2> 
<p>Snow/Snowing - Particles of frozen water or ice falling from the sky.</p>
<p>Hail - Ice chunks falling from the sky.</p>
<p>Thunder - Dissipation of electrostatic energy form the sky grounding to the earth.</p>
<p>Dust storm - Heavy winds in a dusty or sandy area that causes a storm of earthly particles in the air.</p>
