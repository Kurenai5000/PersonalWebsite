<h1>Directions</h1> 

<p>Directions are usually perfect divisions of space. Up and down, or forwards and backwards. They help us to navigate and even when creating objects and designing stuff.
<br>This technically is an artificial concept but nature embodies in a way.</p>

<h2>Two dimensional</h2> 
<p>Center - Center of directions.</p>
<p>Forward - North.</p>
<p>Forward right - North east.</p>
<p>Right - East.</p>
<p>Back right -  South east.</p>
<p>Back - South.</p>
<p>Back left - South west.</p>
<p>Left - West.</p>
<p>Forward left - North west.</p>

<h2>Three dimensional</h2> 
<p>Center - Within.</p>
<p>Up - Sky, where the head is pointing.</p>
<p>Down - Ground, where the feet are on.</p>
<p>Front - Infront, what you see.</p>
<p>Right - Right arm/side of body.</p>
<p>Back - Behind, what you can't see.</p>
<p>Left - Left side of body/arm.</p>

<h2>Side notes</h2> 
<p>-You can also have north, north east as a direction in between north and north east. This extends for all other in between directions.</p>
<p>-Directions are just separations or divisions of space and angles. They are not real, so to speak but concepts that manifest in reality in a real sense.</p>
<p>-You can also swap North to be back and south to be front if you want.</p>
