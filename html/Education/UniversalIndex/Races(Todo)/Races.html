<h1>Races</h1> 

<p>Races are the major ethic groups that live in certain regions on the earth plane. Each race grew up, developed and evolved in different temperatures, with different diets, ideas and experiences than another which forms who they are physically and mentally. 
<br>Races who grow in similar locations or together may start to look similar or act similar, their langauges may share words or a tone and type.
<br>This section is focused on humans, though studying different types of animal classes will teach you about the same concept. For example, all the types of dogs or cats.</p>

<h2>Major ethic groups</h2>
<p>Do note this is a rough summarisation and is just meant to get the major areas.</p>
<North America - In Northern America there are various native ethic groups as well as primarily British, German and french with small ammounts of Italian. >
