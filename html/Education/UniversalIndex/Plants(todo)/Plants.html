<h1>Plants</h1> 

<p>Plants encompas what is called "The vegetable kingdom". This includes regular plants, herbs, trees, their fruit, nuts, seeds, bark, leaves, stems, branches and other plant like things. 
<br>Mushrooms are included in this category as are other fungus, algea and anything else that passively grows on the ground and water that isn't an animal or mineral. Bacteria could perhaps even be a part of this kingdom as well, or an intermediary between this and the animal kingdom.</p>
