<h1>Time and Dates</h1> 

<p>Time fundamentally is a measurement of change. The movement of the stars, changing of the seasons and changing times of day are ways to track this. Ageing of animals and humans and growth of crops analogously relate. Time falls under Saturn philosophically.
<br>We use clocks and calenders to record and track time. Our time tracking methods were based on the stars but become somewhat muddied as time went on and humanity fell in its wisdom.</p>

<h2>Cycles</h2>
<p>To truly understand time you must understand cycles. Days are cycles of the sun. Months are cycles of the moon. Seasons are three moons. Years are cycles of the seasons(depending on location depends on how many).
<br>A second is a small measurement of time around how much it takes a small object to drop from your hand to the floor. 60 seconds makes a minute. 60 minutes makes an hour and 24 hours makes a full day or 12 hours for day and 12 for night depending on the season.
<br>7 days creates a week. Around 28-31 days makes a standard month while around 29.5 days makes a lunar month. 12 months makes a year.</p>

<p>There are greater cycles of many years that some people track, but I'm not sure what they're based on so I wont speak more of them.
<br>72 years is an average human life cycle. Usually maturity is tracked by saturnian cycles which are around 28-30 years. This is usually when someone is considered an adult or middle aged, then an elder around late 50's or early 60's.</p>

<p>The Winter solstice is the longest night of the year. It can mark the beginning of winter or the depths of winter depending on how you view things. The summer solstice is the longest day of light. 
<br>Then there is also the autumn and spring equinox which are days that are equal in day and night hours.</p>

<h2>Common times</h2>
<p>60 Seconds = 1 Minute 
<br>60 Minutes = 1 Hour
<br>24 Hours = 1 Day
<br>7 Days = 1 Week
<br>4-5 Weeks = 1 Month
<br>12 Months = 1 Year</p>

<h2>Days of the week and months of the year</h2>
<p>Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday.
<br>
<br>January, February, March, April, May, June, July, August, September, October, November, December.</p>


<h2>Side notes</h2> 
<p>A year can have 365 or 366 days depending on if it is a leap year or not.
<br>
<br>There are 52 weeks in a year.</p>
<p>Daylight savings should be removed in my opinion.</p>
