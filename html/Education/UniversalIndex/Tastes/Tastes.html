<h1>Tastes</h1> 

<p>Taste is sensed by the tongue for animals. Smell also can mentally change or aid your perception of taste.
<br>The tongue has different areas to sense taste. The front is sweet, back is bitter. Middle is savoury, front side is salty and back side is sour.</p>
<p>You might think spicy to be a flavor, maybe that's true but I think that the burning sensation is just that, a sensation and not a flavor. Though peppers do have their own flavor.
<br>In this example we can see that sensation can add to taste. Similarly, smell and texture also add to the experience of eating and taste as well as sight.
<br>Complex flavors seem to be smells while simple ones seem to be raw tongue sensed tastes.</p>


<h2>Major tastes</h2>
<p>Sweet - Uplifting, energising, pleasurable and relaxing.</p>
<p>Salty - Grounding, nourishing and satisfying.</p>
<p>Savoury - Satisfying, full, stimulates appetite.</p>
<p>Sour - Tense, internally stimulating, tightening.</p>
<p>Bitter - Uncomfortable, harsh, tense.</p>
