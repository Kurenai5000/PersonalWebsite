<h1>Temperature</h1> 

<p>Temperature is a measure of heat or cold. It is felt through the body and effects mood, peoples bodies, personalities, their minds and other things. Each country has a unique range of temperatures which changes during each season.
<br>Physically is seems to cause contraction for cold and relaxation for warm.
<br>Simple temperature ranges are from hot to neutral to cold. Very hot and extremely hot are some, then very cold and extremely cold are another.</p>

<p>Celsius is a good measuring language tool to use for temperature. 0 degrees celsius is where water freezes while 100 is where it boils. Temperatures up to several hundred to even a thousand are where metal starts to boil/melt. 
<br>Celcius can also go to negative temperatures. Some other elements will consolidate/freeze at very low temperatures like gasses. 

<h2>Common Temperatures</h2> 
<p>Extremely cold - Damaging to the body and starts to freeze most things. Below 0 or negative degrees celsius.</p>
<p>Very cold - Painful and mildly damaging to the body. Around 0-7 degrees celsius.</p>
<p>Cold - Chilly and mildly uncomfortable. Around 7-13 degrees celsius.</p>
<p>Neutral - Not too hot or cold. Around 13-18 degrees celsius.</p>
<p>Warm - Pleasant but not unbearable heat. Around 18-25 degrees celsius.</p>
<p>Hot - Mildly uncomfortable and damaging to the body. Around 25-32 degrees celsius.</p>
