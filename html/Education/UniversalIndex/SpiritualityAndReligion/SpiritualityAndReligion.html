<h1>Spirituality And Religion</h1> 

<p>Religion is very interlinked in race and culture. Different ethnic groups/regions have their own religion which encompasses a set of rules, morals, ethics, ways to act, how to live, science or systems of how the world works, practices/rituals and other things.
</p>

<p>Each religion has a set of gods or singular "God" and lesser figures. These are usually figures that represent planets and stars, natural elements, forces, regions, great plants or animals. 
<br>Each religions great figures can be translated to a common relating figure like that of Hades, Saturn and Satan being the figure of earth or the planet Saturn, restriction, time, cycles, farming and evil.
<br>The supreme God can be linked to all things and everything that exists and doesn't. Sometimes God is then broken up into two figures, a good God and evil figure. This can be seen of as the material world being the evil figure and the spiritual or upper world being the good God.</p>

<h2>Spirituality</h2>

<p>Spirituality is more a modern, refined and less culturally or racially restricted system. Modern spirituality arose from the combination of many different religions, understandings and teachings. It syncretised or combined religions.
<br>Chakras, being the energetic centers of the body which related to major areas and organs were taken. Meditation, different bodily and hand postures, breathing techniques, the use of herbs, minerals and animal parts. Rituals like magic were added too.</p>

<h2>Further understanding the fundamentals</h2>

<p>In a more raw sense, this field of study and practice relates to the upper world, the sky, space, the mind or brain and neurological system in the body. The imagination. To understand and control energy is the basis of spiritual power. Spiritual means immaterial or energetic, vaporous.
<br>Mental and psychic powers come under this.</p>

<p>Virginity was common among priest and priestess. The loss of generative fluids and energies deplete the nervous system and brain of its power. The power within these fluids seem to be electromagnetic.
<br>Purification rituals in a raw sense are cleaning practices. To physically clean something, remove dirt, remove bad smells, but also to remove bad energy.
<br>Blessing clears an object or persons bad energy and also gives them a "good charge" which helps improve their luck.</p>

<p>Different countries have similar holymen or shamans, religious figures. Tribal societies usually have a shaman, seer or witchdoctor. Higher tier societies have magicians and priests.
<br>These holymen could control the weather, animals, perform blessings or curses, even levitate or perform other true acts of magic.</p>
