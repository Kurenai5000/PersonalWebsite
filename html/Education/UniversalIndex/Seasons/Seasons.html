<h1>Seasons</h1> 

<p>Seasons are divisions of a year. We usually divide the year into four, though different areas of the world may divide it into two, three, five or another number. <br>These divisions represent things like the rainy season, the dry season, the cold season, warm season, windy, season, harvest season, etc.</p>

<h2>Common four</h2> 
<p>Spring - Time = Beginning of year. Temperature = Cool moist.</p>
<p>Summer - Time = Second quarter. Temperature = Hot and dry.</p>
<p>Autumn - Time = Halfway of the year. Temperature = Temperate to cold and moist.</p>
<p>Winter - Time = Last part/quarter of year. Temperature = Cold and moist or dry.</p>

<h2>Side notes</h2> 
<p>-Different countries and regions will have their seasons at different times and for different lengths as well as differing intensities.</p>
