<h1>Sounds</h1> 

<p>The ears process sound and the throat and mouth creates sound commonly in the animal body. Though, any body part can create sound as sound can be made from vibration or two things touching.
<br>Sound is air or effects air. Technically a vibration of air. 
<br>Sound based technology uses alternating positive/negative energy/AC power to vibrate a membrane that vibrates the air. 
<br>The opposite of a microphone is essentially the same, a small membrane that is vibrated. This vibration pushes a magnet back and forward near a copper wire coil that creates an AC signal.</p>

<p>In audio, there are low frequency sounds which are called bass, middle tones and higher pitch tones which are treble. 
<br>We segment individual small sound ranges into notes. These notes make scales which are set of notes that have a certain feeling to them like happy or sad.
<br>When multiple notes are played together it is called a chord, which also has an emotional tone to it like complex, sad, happy, leading or completing.</p>

<p>Usually bass instruments or sounds are made by larger, denser and heavier objects or instruments while high pitch sounds are made by smaller, thinner, glassier and lighter objects.</p>

<h2>Types of sounds</h2>
<p>Wind - Wishing, ethereal and high pitch. Can be sharp.</p>
<p>Dull - When physical objects tap against each other, usually wood or dense objects.</p>
<p>Metallic - When metallic objects hit against each other or metallic drums and strings are played. Usually high pitch.</p>
<p>Animal - Sounds of animals or the human voice.</p>
<p>Plastic/skin - Skin drums and elastic sounds. Ranges from bassy to high pitch.</p>
<p>Electrical - Usually high pitch. Tinny or high pitch. Spark gaps/electricity.</p>
<p>Watery/glassy - Semi ethereal. Can be sharp or dull. Bassy or high pitch. Rain, water, rubbing or tapping glass.</p>
