<h1>Colors</h1> 

<p>In the most raw sense, everything you see is just a color. Colors are a division of what is visible so to speak. A base color can have a light or darker version of it depending on what kind of light or angle it is shown in. 
<br>Color wheels show all visible colors. You can use it to see opposing colors like orange and blue. 
<br>
<br>Different colors will also have differing darkness(called values) like yellow is very light while purple is usually very dark.
<br>Red, orange and yellow relate to earth. Green to plants, the middle ground. Blue, purple and pink to the sky.
<br>All colors can be made up of the primary three, yellow, blue and red. Yellow and blue mixed forms green. Yellow and red makes orange. Blue and red makes purple.</p>
