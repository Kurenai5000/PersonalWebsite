<h1>Mathematics</h1> 
<p>Maths lets us work with numbers and amounts of things. We can simulate reality in a virtual way on paper, computer or with items and models.
<br>There are a couple main mathematical functions that can be done, like adding, taking away, dividing and multiplying. There are many more complicated functions depending on what you need.</p>
<p>Mathematics is the beginning of creating mental models, but it does have a very practical use in business, science, engineering, cooking, life planning, time and dates, measurement and geometry and many other fields.</p>


<h2>Basic math functions</h2> 
<p>Addition - The symbol for addition is "+", the word is plus. It allows you to combine two numbers into one. For example, 2+2=4, 4+4=8, 16+12=28.
<br>This merged two numbers to form their sum.</p>

<p>Subtraction - The symbol for subtraction is "-", the word is negate. It takes away the second number from the first. 4-3=1. 4 is the first number, 3 is the second. This equals 1.
<br>More examples, 2-2=0, 6-3=3, 15-5=10.</p>

<p>Multiplication - The symbol for multiplication is "* or x", called times. It takes the first number and adds it together by the amount of times the second number equals. So 2*3=6 takes 2 as our main number and 3 as our second which makes 3 2's. 2+2+2=6. You can also reverse it. 3*2=6 or 3+3=6.
<br>More examples, 2*8=16, 12*5=60, 3*7=21.</p>

<p>Division - The symbol for division is "/", called divided by. In division the second number goes into the first as many times as it can, this is your answer. 
<br>For example, 10/5=2. 5+5=10 so two 5's go into 10 which gives us an answer of 2. 10/2=5, so it can be reversed to check your answer. Meaning the answer and divider can be flipped.
<br>More examples, 4/1=4, 12/3=4, 14/7=2</p>

<h2>More concepts</h2>

<p>Decimal point/Floating point numbers - Sometimes you'll run into an issue when dividing like how to work out what 11/5 is equal to. 5 goes into 11 two times but is left with an extra 1. 
<br>For this we can use decimal points to divide numbers into an infinite amount of smaller parts, like small change for money. 
<br>So 11/5=2.2 since 1/5=0.2. 5 0.2's create a 1. 0.2+0.2+0.2+0.2+0.2=1</p>

<p>Negative numbers - If you start at 0 and flip or reverse things, you'll go into the negatives. So adding negative -1 to 0 = -1. Adding -2 to -1 ='s -3.
<br>Adding negative numbers to positive numbers acts like negating. So 2 + -2 = 0. </p>

<p>Zero - Zero is the medium plane or balancing point between positive and negative numbers. The upper and lower world of mathematics. * by or / by 0 will = 0.
<br>Adding and subtracting with zero does work though so 2+0 or 0+2 ='s 2 while 2-0 or 0-2 ='s 0.</p>

<p>Algebra - Algebra allows us to substitute numbers with symbols like the common alphabet. a+2=4 is using algebra. We can solve this problem in reverse. What plus 2 equals 4? 2 does. So a ='s 2. Another example is 6/b=2. b would be 3 as 6/3='s 2 as 3 goes into 6 two times.</p>
