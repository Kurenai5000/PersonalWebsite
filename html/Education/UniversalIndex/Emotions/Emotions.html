<br>Physically Each organ has an associated emotion which stimulates it.
<br>They can range from good to bad and neutral, simple and complex. Usually a life experience will also come with a corresponding emotion. The loss of someone will bring great sadness while eating delicious food will make you feel satisfied and happy.
