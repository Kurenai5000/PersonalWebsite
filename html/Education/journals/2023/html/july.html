<h4>1/7/23</h4>

<p>There is a natural harmony of nature that allows for subtle and slow transformations that is common in nature. This harmony seems to be when for example the temperature is fairly neutral, with fluctuations as in the seasons and times of day that are not too extreme on either side of hot or cold. There are of course various regions which represent the extremes but growth in those lands is stunted.</p>
<br>
<p>A mix of moisture and heat create humidity which is a kind of life energy that creatures, plants and perhaps even minerals seem to thrive on.</p>
 <br>
<h4>2/7/23</h4>
 
<p>Voltage drops in a circuit when a component is using it.</p>
<br>
<p>Flesh is like organic plastic that naturally forms.</p>
 <br>
<p>I think knowledge of energy/electromagnetism has been an occult things and the societies that figured it out have prospered. In the past they would of used simpler technology in order to transmit energy for audio/video, etc.  This was probably knowledge of wise men and magicians. The art of magic, to manipulate this energetic force.</p>
 <br>
<p>Things from lower earth - metals can harness this energy and allow it to travel in them. They are highly susceptible to its forces as we can see with magnetism that can levitate or push a metal.</p>
 <br>
<h4>3/7/23</h4>
 
<p>I think radios and transmitters vibrate and you tune something to the same frequency to pick up on this resonance the same way that guitar strings can resonate to another sound.</p>
 <br>
<p>LEDs - White and blue - 3v, yellow, red, green - 2v.</p>
 <br>
<p>Once your OS has a c compiler then you can run c programs.</p>
<br>
<h4>5/7/23</h4>
 
<p>Try to take on a goal or task that you can't handle. You'll learn a lot along the way even if you fail. Every time you take on another giant task you keep learning and growing.</p>
 <br>
<p>Ohm's Law (I = V/R).</p>
 <br>
<p>I think stress/pain is what causes growth. When it heals you grow stronger. Perhaps always taking pain killers stops you from growing since it takes away that pain/inflammation.</p>
 <br>
<p>We need to build a world outside of identification. That way governments wont be able to control us. This means personally controlled banking and trade, communication, travel and transportation, housing, etc. To navigate the world without any restriction from verifications or taxes. We need to build and run the infrastructure ourselves.</p>
 <br>
<h4>8/7/23</h4>
 
<p>Usually once a man conquers and makes his kingdom he stops taking risks and doing crazy stuff which is what built his business/kingdom in the first place. He makes it more friendly for the masses.</p>
 <br>
<p>White people take longer to grow physically than other races.</p>
 <br>
<h4>9/7/23</h4>
 
<p>You will usually fight your hardest battles in your worst of states. Others that attack you are weak and opportunistic. They only strike when they see an opening.</p> 
 <br>
<p>When things keep going wrong, breaking, etc. Someone might be cursing you. Either outlast the curses energy, fix your stuff, wait or strike back at whoever is doing it. Life has physics and usually follows it. But when the magical realm interferes with reality then these physics unravel and are manipulated.</p>
 <br>
<h4>10/7/23</h4>
 
<p>There's a part of alchemy and chemistry which is all the different kinds of liquids you can make. The liquids of each plant and mineral, each animal part. Slimy liquid, fizzy or more airy liquid, hot liquid, cold, burning, cooling, etc.</p>
 <br>
<p>When you focus on the storage organs you build up resources of that element. The bladder is an area to restore your water energy or sexual energy. It is like the storer of liquid and then the small intestine is a burner or cooker or heater. So maybe focusing on the small intestine can help to generate heat.</p>
 <br>
<p>One good way to learn is to categorize, use hierarchy and natural systems of organization. For example, combining all of the "red" things or the "blue" things, the high things and low things.</p>
 <br>
<h4>11/7/23</h4>

 <br>
<p>Arm/leg strength is important. It dictates the strength of your strikes. They are the major functional areas of the body. Train them.</p>
 <br>
<p>Numbers have an analogness to them and you will figure this out the more you work with them. Especially in programming. Meaning you can slowly nudge the number to another value, higher or lower to test what it does and eventually get the result you want or near it. So moving a picture more to the left or right by adjusting the X value. Then float or dot point numbers are like a micro scale tool.</p>
 <br>
<p>Spot weld delicate electronics with metal strips instead of soldering them. I managed to burn and tear out a couple tiny solar panels terminals by the heat of solder.</p>
 <br>
<h4>12/7/23</h4>
 
<p>True freedom relies on proper rulership of land and the removal of the ID verification system.</p>
 <br>
<p>Sugar might be a mana crystal of sorts.</p>
 <br>
<p>Heat different solid ingredients together to form pills.</p>
 <br>
<h4>13/7/23</h4>
 
<p>The priests were the high cast. They saw the masses for what they are, animal like and saw themselves as higher, closer to divinity.</p>
 <br>
<p>Everything you do gets you closer to your goals, even if it doesn't feel like it. Taking a new path is simply just a second path to the same place.</p>
 <br>
<p>There are different levels of heat and how they effect matter. Living and organic matter are effected and killed or preserved by differing temperatures. Similarly dryness can effect them.</p>
 <br>
<p>-Perhaps enlightenment and all that stuff is to understand and experience void nature. To completely detach from the world of society, family and even the regular, physical world. Once you achieve it you switch internally. After that you are a player character instead of an NPC. You then can return to the material world, to family.</p>

<p>Drugs temporarily grant this experience and state because they open up and stimulate the mind and crown of the head. Similarly, experiences of extreme stress, lack of sleep, food and lack of physical safety as well as awakenings through sex, lack of sex, exercise and many other experiences can unlock or take you closer to this state. Hence why there are fields of meditations and exercise that lead people to it.</p>
 <br>
<h4>15/7/23</h4>
 
<p>Practice magic. The will power you use in magic is the same you use in your body.</p>
 <br>
<p>To do stuff with your body is physical. To do stuff with your mind is magical. You build mental strength by practicing magic, trying to open and close doors, cabinets, push objects, etc. This relies on the brain and its strength.</p>
 <br>
<h4>16/7/23</h4>
 
<p>-A young man is naive and needs to learn to make money/gain resources and to use them properly. There is an evil mindstate that these men can fall into and as they become men, they become only focused on money and status. They start to look physically a certain way, childish and angry but still old or mature. As society only judges a man based on his status and money, they only improve or care for these parts of themselves. They become immature children who get angry when their status or money is at risk, when their business is harmed or threatened. These men do everything they can to viciously protect their job or business at the expense of others, usually kicking other younger men down, abusing them all for the sake of keeping their position.</p>
 
<p>We have to be careful about falling into the trap of greed for money and status as men. Society values men for their money, status and power over overs so a lot of men purely seek this. Though their home life, emotional self, creativity and intellect are complete trash at the expense of a nice outward appearance to their company or to society through their business and job.</p>
 
<p>Learning to win the game, master it but not to be controlled by it and become an NPC cog in the system of society is important. Your virtue and good values are not worth exchanging for more money and status. True peace is found at the root where humility and humbleness reside.</p>
 <br>
<p>A hydroxide salt is a spiritual salt, different from regular sea salt since it will evaporate in air.</p>
 <br>
<h4>17/7/23</h4>
 
<p>The same way that you get caught up in blocks, barriers and nets when trying to move forward and do good things metaphorically, you fall into safety nets and into soft landings when you do evil and go the wrong way. Life tries to stop us from moving forward or backwards, doing good or evil. So the road to hell is slow, but that to heaven is also.</p>
 <br>
<p>If a mans fault is seeking of excessive status and wealth then a young mans fault is being lazy, not learning.</p>
 <br>
<h4>18/7/23</h4>
 
<p>Chakras and major organs, also relating to elements - Earth is bowels, feces is the physical matter that the body produces. Water is the bladder, urine being one of the bodies liquids that it produces. Fire is the digestive system, the small intestines. Fire relating to the heat and digestive acids perhaps. Air of the lungs, air as in air which you breathe. Aether of the inner throat. If you make a sound it arises from this region to crate sound vibration. Darkness is of the inner middle brain. This is where you can imagine in the field of darkness in your mind. Light of the crown. The peak which can cause you to see colors if focused on.</p>
 <br>
<p>Passive metal is an anode and corrodes. Active becomes a cathode. Metals higher in galvanic series become anodes, hence corrode.</p>
 <br>
<p>Perhaps womens good physical fortune comes from them being inherently more physical, negatively natured. So for a man to become more negatively natured he starts to learn the physical world and gains good fortune from that. Then as a woman ages she might loose her connection to the earth and become less powerful, desirable, etc.</p>
 <br>
<h4>19/7/23</h4>
 
<p>Architecture and infrastructure is a product of the people who made it. In simple terms - buildings are a reflection of their creator.</p>
 <br>
<h4>20/7/23</h4>
 
<p>Maybe in the outer earth are alternate humanoid creatures that evolved from different animal hybrids, in different environments but reached a high level of ability and intelligence.</p>
  <br>
<p>Perhaps there are times where animals are more inclined to cross breed and then times where they are more stable and depending on the kind of animal, some might try to stay pure.</p>
 <br>
<p>Mythological creatures may just be animal-animal or human animal hybrids.</p>
 <br>
<p>Animals might go through hybridization cycles of hybridizing and then stabilizing.</p>
 <br>
<p>The human animal hybrids born from human men seem to have human heads and animal bodies while the ones from a woman have an animal head and human body.</p>
 <br>
<p>Purge poison first then strengthen the patient in order for them to heal.</p>
 <br>
<h4>21/7/23</h4>
 
<p>To focus is to feel something.</p>
 <br>
<p>To focus is to feel, to see, smell, etc. It is to sense. Usually narrowing which sense is used and its scope or range. Then there is peripheral or expanded sense which opens it up.</p>
 <br>
<p>I notice that you can walk and run faster by changing the speed that your legs move around the hips. So focus on the hips and just try to move the legs faster as the hip is the primary rotational joint for these activities. Use less resistance and tension as well in order to not strain.</p>
 <br>
<h4>22/7/23</h4>
 
<p>Transformers can increase voltage.</p>
 <br>
<p>A lot of men who specialize in sex and dating look very pale and sick. Excessive casual sex seems to wash out a mans vitality.</p>
 <br>
<p>What if different races of people came from different animal hybrids that formed into their current race.</p>
 <br>
<p>Mana is definitely brain energy. Having it lets you do magic. Mind creates reality because it makes us do something new besides old cycles.</p>
 <br>
<p>Hutchison effect - extremely high voltage in resonance. Pump high voltage through coils.</p>
 
<p>-"Common methods to replicate the Hutchison Effect is to use pulses or continuous high-frequency (500 MHz to GHz+) waveforms in the RF and MM-wave EM bands at high amplitude to create standing-waves, orthogonal and/or scalar waveforms which can cause lifting effects (i.e. see "Acoustic Levitation" on Youtube to see objects levitated in-air!) and melting/fusing effects within Crystalline materials such as metals, glass and ceramic.</p> 
 
<p>The waveforms tend to cause temporary cascading molecular bond failures that lets crystalline materials slide apart effortlessly. Once the standing wave, orthogonal and/or scalar waveform stops being emitted or created, the cascade failure also stops and the molecular bonds reform AROUND the other sinking/fusing object within the crystalline metal, glass or ceramic.</p>
 
<p>You power supply needs to output high voltages and high amperages and your RF/MM-wave emitter needs to emit extremely high frequencies from 500 Mhz to One Gigahertz and sometimes up to 120 Gigahertz in order for this to work. Use 10 MHz steps to figure out WHICH BANDS of RF and MM-waveforms are most effective in causing the effects noted by Hutchison! It is also possible that lower frequency pulsed or continuous 50 Hz to 500 MHz waveforms are what is needed to produce the standing waves, scalar and orthogonal waveforms needed for this.</p> 
 
<p>I would also see if using a waveform reflecting mechanism SIMILAR to a Neutron Reflector (i.e. a straight or curved wall of Tungsten, Manganese, or other heavy metal) in order focus waveforms towards the objects in question. You MIGHT consider this reflector to be a form of cavity resonator and/or waveguide.  Maybe look at how microwave ovens build their cavity resonators and waveguides and see if you can duplicate that structure to focus EM waves towards an object.</p>

<p>There could also be harmonics at play or some sort of signal summing taking place that needs to recorded and examined further."</p>
 <br>
<p>Supposedly magnesium boosts amperage in batteries.</p>
 <br>
<p>Perhaps England is like the Japan of Europe.</p>
 <br>
<h4>24/7/23</h4>
 
<p>Crystal batteries use magnesium sulphate (Epsom salt) with other enhancements such as alum and borax as the electrolyte.</p>
 <br>
<h4>26/7/23</h4>
 
<p>Humanity learned to master cheese making and carpentry, then the development of technology like telephones and tv's. We are now unlocking AI. The world is like a civilization game tech tree that we unlock as we go along.</p>
 <br>
<p>Warning - Do not overcharge lithium batteries or charge them for too long.</p>
 <br>
<h4>27/7/23</h4>
 
<p>Mind, mental energy, magic, the mental world</p>
<br>
<p>If copper and aluminium are put in an electrolyte then the aluminium starts to degrade as it is less noble than the copper. If copper and galvanised steel are put together, the copper will degrade.</p>
 <br>
<p>Oil and coal are the earths crap and piss. We are refining all kinds of matters out of physical waste. Might be transformed bacterially from something underground.</p>
 <br>
<p>Anxiety might be a heart condition. Also kidney.</p>
 <br>
<p>Perhaps peace of the heart is spiritual peace.</p>
 <br>
<p>I wonder if copper is the blue mana potion and gold the red. Supposedly copper helps the kidneys. So then kidney and heart maybe. So this makes you youthful, darker hair, etc.</p>
 <br>
<p>I think stimulating the heart transmutes the lower waters up.</p>
 <br>
<p>When you do something you start with a base. All of the imperfections in this base are then cast onto whatever you build on top of it.
So the simpler things are and less moving parts a system has, the better. Since all of the other parts take on the issues of the root, and then can become further corrupted if the base is not perfect.</p>
 <br>
<h4>28/7/23</h4>
 
<p>Investigations into copper. What if the old age was a copper age. What if it can transmit natural energies the same way that iron repulses them.</p>
 <br>
<p>You can chemically alter materials or alter them through natural means like that of heat, water, fermentation, etc.</p>
 <br>
<p>When you add things together in chemical terms, if they mix properly then you get a chemical combination of them. This is a simplified version of things.</p>
 <br>
<p>Depending on what minerals are underground where people live is what kind of culture they will have since the minerals effects them, other animals and plants.</p>
 <br>
<p>What if **** are the aliens who are trying to take genetics from other cultures in order to regain their form. Since they look so disgusting and mutated.</p>
 <br>
<h4>29/7/23</h4>
 
<p>Seems that the older cultures might of been much more Venusian than todays cultures.</p>
 <br>
<h4>30/7/23</h4>
 
<p>Mercury in a ball high up probably receives sky energy.</p>
 <br>
<p>High voltage field might produce antigravity.</p>
 <br>
<p>Supposedly plasma lets you mess with spacetime, it pumps a lot of EM into the air.</p>
 <br>
<h4>31/7/23</h4>
 
<p>I think amperage in batteries is boosted by surface area. So the larger the metals the bigger the amperage. A spiral roll like how they do it with modern batteries is probably the most efficient use of surface area, similarly the stacked ones are efficient too like in phone batteries. Then voltage is probably just difference of metal and the chemicals make them more reactive maybe. So then the salt ocean is like a giant high amperage battery maybe? Otherwise I assume that humans can create super high amp batteries in the past by just using giant metal jars and big metal electrodes in salt or other electrolytes.</p>
 <br>
<p>Having a chamber and putting some metal in then blasting it with EMF can probably transmute metal. Postnote – That’s called a microwave.</p>
