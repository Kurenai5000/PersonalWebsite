<h4>1/6/23</h4>
 
<p>Mana is the energy of mind. It called shen in the daoist tradition. To train and gather this energy, focus gently on the brain. This cultivates your mind or intellect, allowing you to think more clearly, have better senses and intuition.</p>
<br>
<h4>2/6/23</h4>
 
<p>If you learn to dissolve or melt quartz you can make your own crystals.</p>
 <br>
<p>Corundum - aluminum oxide. A lot of gems are made from it.</p>
 <br>
<p>High pressure boiling of water with I imagine hydroxides dissolve crystals and minerals.</p>
 <br>
<p>Cooking minerals in a molten flux. Melting corundum with a salt to color it.</p>
 <br>
<h4>3/6/23</h4>
 
<p>There's usually a wet and hot process to most alchemical processes.</p>
 <br>
<p>Crystallized ki might be crystallized oxygen. Maybe ki is related to oxygen.</p>
 <br>
<p>Salts, earths, clays, glasses.</p>
 <br>
<p>Salts can become molten from carbon and graphite electrolysis electricity.</p>
 <br>
<h4>4/6/23</h4>
 
<p>Speed is a quality of the nerves.</p>
 <br>
<p>Earths/dirts seem like the matrix for crystals, salts, oxides, ores.</p>
 <br>
<h4>6/6/23</h4>
 
<p>Cardio is a heating force on the body.</p>
 <br>
<p>I think in batteries the voltage you get is just the voltage difference between the metals so one becomes negatively charged and the other becomes positive and there is a difference between them like one might be -5 and the other +5 making 10 volts.</p>
 <br>
<h4>7/6/23</h4>

<p>Some systems have Jupiter as the throat while mercury is the mind. So there's the lower and upper mind. Venus as the bladder/genitals area, mars as the digestion, solar plexus. Saturn the liver or bowel and sol the heart.</p>
 <br>
<h4>8/6/23</h4>
 
<p>Focus electrodes or lasers at point in space and then zap it at a certain frequency to create matter, a matter printer hypothetically.</p>
 <br>
<p>Jupiter might be teaching if it is the throat.</p>
 <br>
<p>Before we had words for electromagnetic energy and frequency, etc we used the word magic.</p>
 <br>
<p>Mix coal and ore, cook to make crude metal.</p>
 <br>
<h4>9/6/23</h4>
 
<p>Spirit, magic. These are old world words for electromagnetic phenomena, energy, mind, mental.</p>
 <br>
<p>Restaurants are places that satisfy the stomach/belly or martian center. Inns or motels satisfy the root. Brothels the sacral. Libraries the mental/mercurial. Churches the sacred, perhaps crown. Graveyards are very root natured, very negative and relaxing, cold like lead. A bar perhaps the heart, with music, alcohol, conversation, warmth.</p>
 <br>
<h4>10/6/23</h4>
 
<p>Big back sprocket on wheel gives a lot of torque. Small gives speed.</p>
 <br>
<p>When cooking, think more about the physics of what you're doing and trying to achieve. A soup can become a sauce which can become a syrup depending on how much you simmer it down.</p>
<br>
<p>Different times have different yields in harvesting resources, money, food, etc. Meaning that you get a big catch during some times of the year and a small one in other times. Learn those cycles to know when to rest and when to work.</p>
 <br>
<h4>11/6/23</h4>
 
<p>Where there is movement there is sound and sound there is movement.</p>
 <br>
<p>Hunger, thirst, tiredness, boredom, lust, play. These are some basic desires that should be satisfied to have optimal functioning of the body.</p>
 <br>
<p>Spinning mercury creates EMF. Measurable on a tri-field meter.</p>
 <br>
<h4>14/6/23</h4>
 
<p>Moisture or wetness is what allows for the merging of two things. It provides a transfer medium for the volatile gases/spirits to travel perhaps.
When people have sex or kiss, they connect skin and flesh with moisture, hence creating a connection.</p>
 <br>
<h4>15/6/23</h4>
 
<p>Amperage and voltage seem like positive and negative, high and low frequencies of the same thing. Amperage being very earth like, underground and voltage being high and sky like, cold.</p>
 <br>
<h4>18/6/23</h4>
 
<p>-"Two other Baopuzi Inner Chapters mention wushi. First, "Gold and Cinnabar" (chap. 4) has several references. The Five Minerals are used to produce the Jiuguangdan (九光丹) elixir that will supposedly raise the dead.</p>

<p>There is also the Ninefold Radiance Elixir, which uses a method similar but not quite like that of the Nine-Cycle Elixir. Various ingredients are mixed and fired separately with each of the five minerals, cinnabar, realgar, arsenolite, laminar malachite, and magnetite [五石者, 丹砂, 雄黃, 白礜, 曾青, 慈石也]. Each mineral is put through five cycles and assumes five hues, so that altogether twenty-five hues result. Separate containers are each filled with one ounce of each hue. If you wish to raise a body that has not been dead for fully three days, bathe the corpse with a solution of one spatula of the blue elixir, open its mouth, and insert another spatula full; it will revive immediately"</p>
 <br>
<h4>20/6/23</h4>
 
<p>Toffee is similar to plastic. A fat/oil to give form and a sugar to harden it.</p>
<br>
<p>We might be able to make plastic out of animal fats or plant oils.</p>
 <br>
<h4>22/6/23</h4>
 
<p>The pelvis area is lower hell and the guts is upper hell. Liver-stomach area lower earth and lungs-heart is upper earth. Mouth is lower heaven and brain is upper.</p>
 <br>
<p>Protein probably feeds the lower, sweets the upper, oils the middle.</p>
 <br>
<h4>25/6/23</h4>

<p>For the first many years of a persons life their body will develop. Then eventually the consciousness develops and they become alive in their body.</p>
 <br>
<p>Feels like the world ended around 10 years ago and now we're just living in the aftermath of it.</p>
 <br>
<p>I think voltage is speed and amperage is power.</p>
 <br>
<p>"Polyaniline: Polyaniline is a conducting polymer that can be used as a cathode material in some types of rechargeable batteries, including certain types of lithium-ion batteries."</p>
 <br>
<p>"Polyethylene oxide (PEO) - a polymer that can be combined with salts to form solid electrolytes. Polyacrylonitrile (PAN) - another polymer that can be used in solid electrolytes. Ceramic-based electrolytes - materials such as lithium ceramic electrolytes (e.g., lithium phosphorous oxynitride or lithium garnet) that offer high ionic conductivity and stability."</p>
 <br>
<h4>26/6/23</h4>
 
<p>Things are valued based on what people will pay for them. They pay partly on desire or need.</p>
 <br>
<p>You can essentially destroy any country you want or city, town, etc by putting a bunch of migrants there, homeless ones.</p>
 <br>
<p>Work more if you are dissatisfied with your results.</p>
 <br>
<p>Once you take things seriously you'll figure out how far behind you are. Once you work and get a lot done in a day you'll figure out how much more you need to do.</p>
 <br>
<h4>27/6/23</h4>
 
<p>Occultic forces are usually perpetrated by people, at least I think so.</p>
 <br>
<p>Hair is an antenna.</p>
 <br>
<h4>28/6/23</h4>
 
<p>The Norwegian language sounds alien.</p>
 <br>
<h4>29/6/23</h4>
 
<p>We should lewdly tease the AIs.</p>
 <br>
<h4>30/6/23</h4>
 
<p>Think more about conquering the system instead of escaping it.</p>
 <br>
<p>The asshole is the kinetic root of the genitals. I think this is why the root word for all of them in Chinese is yin - 阴.</p>
 <br>
<p>Burning a bunch of stuff can agitate the sky and cause rain I believe. Perhaps this is why people did this for festivals. Also perhaps burning the wood and the fire gives energy to a prayer/magical ritual.</p>
 <br>
<p>Making a computer loop certain words might work as a magical ritual. Since it is using energy to do so. You are outsourcing the ritual to the pc.</p>
