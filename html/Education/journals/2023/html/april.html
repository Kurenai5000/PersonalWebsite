<p>-For the natural or physical sciences - From physics you learn chemistry, from chemistry you learn biology. These all fall under the domain of alchemy.</p>

<p>For the intangible sciences - From pattern study you learn mathematics. Archetypal science is the root, philosophy might be a secondary. Maths is a more logical and measured way to quantify archetypal science.</p>

<p>I imagine mercury absorbs and augments our etheric power.</p>
 <br>
<p>Working is a modern day hunt.</p>
  <br>
<p>Stillness crystallizes.</p>

<p>If you are near or look at a man it will stimulate your positive energy through sympathetic resonance. If you look at or interact with a woman it will stimulate your feminine energies.</p>
  <br>
<h4>4/4/23</h4>
 
<p>Agriculture is a great way to learn alchemy. To be able to take natural processes and enhance them is very educational about nature.</p>
  <br>
<p>Men go from looking boyish to adultish around 24-26ish. They start to look like a man and then around 32 when they fully actualize as a man. For women it's around 21 when they start to loose their younger, girlish looks. Then again at around 28, become more mature in their looks.</p>
  <br>

<p>“The method is described in classical alchemical language, but most of the materials and methods are clearly described. Mercury was used to produce a species of Philosophers' Stone. The process can be described in chemical terms as follows: Prepare (1) b-meta-cinnabarite (a-cinnabarite will not produce the same results, in my experience), (2) a concentrated solution of a mixture of lime and potash and (3) sulfureted potash (potassium polysulfide). Saturate the cinnabarite with the lime-potash mixture solution, then dry it. Repeat several times until albedo appears. Then saturate with a concentrated solution of potassium polysulfide, and strip the solvent (methyl or ethyl alcohol also can be used). Repeat this step until white needles appear (the Dragon's Teeth). The color changes from yellow to orange to red. The Stone is multiplied by grinding it to powder and repeating (7x) the wash with lime-potash. At this point, the Stone emits lights --- probably from the calcium sulfide byproduct of the reaction mixture. Further elaboration and transmutation of lead to gold can be accomplished according to the skill of the Artist."</p>

<p>Programming is understanding the fundamental mathematics that underlay this reality and applying it in a computer to create a virtual structure.</p>
  <br>
<p>-From morals comes what is socially acceptable and from that comes laws. For example, it is morally ill to kill without reason an innocent person. Socially this is taboo and frowned upon. Lawfully it is illegal.</p>

<p>If the community is against a law, then they will practice it. Drug use for example is socially acceptable in some countries and areas but still illegal. Morally or at a foundational standpoint, drug use harms the body. Hence dealing with an issue at the social level is a good area in order to keep it as a part of culture since rules are broken and morals ignored.</p>
  <br>
<p>Land is meant to be dirt cheap. </p>
  <br>
<p>Using barter and digital forms of barter to avoid tax is a smart idea. If you create a crypto currency or coin then you can barter your coins with other peoples coins without tax since it isn't a currency but an item of barter.</p>
  <br>
<h4>7/4/23</h4>
 
<p>For a robot there are three major parts of it. 1. The movement parts which is the lowest and simplest that use an XYZ co ordinate system. 2. Is the social system which allows it to talk to others, understand emotions, speech, family, community bonds, etc. 3. Is the brain/mind that allows it to virtualise a visual picture, sound or language model. This is where the controller for the other parts is as it must first think up words before it says them so to speak.</p>
  <br>
<p>-Hypothesis of the soul - 
I believe that it is a chaos matrix or engine, similar to a quantum random number generator. The brain and nerves control all of the functions of the body in an electrochemical way. So from this master controller, the body is manipulated. But from the earthly world can also come electromagnetic energy which feeds or allows this soul to exist. A body eats food to fuel the brain.</p>
 
<p>From pure chaos, the state that children are born into comes rigidity, stagnation as the body and neural pathways develop and the chaos forms more into order. This on a practical standpoint means that people go from being conscious and chaotic to being more unconscious or routined, stable. 
Pure chaos is not usable, especially in society so it's more functional to give some boundaries to this chaos and structure it in a more proper way.</p>
 
<p>So to give machines souls in this idea, you would build a randomizer. Either mechanical randomizers, a device that randomly selects an angle could be used or a random number generator on a computer. In a game for example, randomness is used for the NPCs movement patterns, chat decisions or any choice which needs to be made. You can refine this randomness by giving the NPC likes and dislikes so that the NPC will usually move towards the east instead of the west or speak about cats instead of dogs. This is the beginning of personality.</p>
 
<p>From mind comes personality and the body is the physical form or structure which grounds this. The body relies on XYZ plane movement and movement patterns as well as pressure modulation which is fairy easy to program. Though you do need to program a lot of routines like walking, running, sitting, etc.</p>

<p>Science is the white mans religion.</p>
  <br>
<p>HIV/AIDs seems to be a root/Saturnian disorder.</p>
  <br>
<h4>10/4/23</h4>
 
<p>Working with cements and making bricks is like bread dough but with earths.</p>
  <br>
<p>If people have a concept of family then they start to gain resources and power for their family instead of a corporation or country. Hence one reason why family is important. But also why the government does not want this.</p>
  <br>
<p>Beauty is partly how you hold your face. If you try to look beautiful, you will be. Relax the face, don't hold so much tension there.</p>
  <br>
<p>To win any battle you need to be able to attack and defend from any angle, to perform any movement while walking and running/while moving, to be physically invulnerable, have infinite amounts of stamina, have both a close contact attack and a long distance based one. To attack from any angle, close or far away. To do this while standing or moving. To take any blow and not be phased.</p>
  <br>
<p>Learning to program requires immense problem solving.</p>
  <br>
<h4>11/4/23</h4>
 
<p>Zoomers are the rootless generation. Their issues come from being rootless.</p>
  <br>
<p>Chronovisor - a device that receives EMF from the past via crystals to see the past.</p>
  <br>
<h4>12/4/23</h4>
 
<p>When you work and do more external stuff you gain a lot of hot, spiritual energy. This masculinizes women if they work too much and if men don't get enough of this they become feminine.</p>
  <br>
<p>From physics comes chemistry and to understand how to transform physical and spirituals things you need to understand physics.</p>
  <br>
<p>Practice feeling what you want to happen to practice magic.</p>
  <br>
<h4>15/4/23</h4>
 
<p>Connecting in series raises voltage and parallel raises capacity.</p>
  <br>
<h4>16/4/23</h4>
 
<p>If you keep walking you'll eventually get to your destination.</p>
  <br>
<p>72 volt * 150 amp = 10,800 watts.</p>
  <br>
<h4>19/4/23</h4>
 
<p>Meat seems to produce a lot more heat than vegetable foods so it is good for winter and cold areas.</p>
  <br>
<p>Put different stones and natural things together, heat them, wet them, boil them, that is the beginning of chemistry and science.</p>
  <br>
<h4>20/4/23</h4>
 
<p>Research gears and how they increase force/torque and speed.</p>
  <br>
<p>Rochelle salts turn sound into electricity.</p>
  <br>
<h4>21/4/23</h4>
 
<p>Energy in the body seems to be strongest or sharpest in the spine and brain.</p>
  <br>
<p>Spirituality and the occult is electromagnetic.</p>
  <br>
<p>-On spirituality, occultism and how it relates to electromagnetism - 
Occultic and spiritual phenomena I believe can be explained through the brain, nerves and electromagnetism. Stuff like clairvoyance, the ability to see real locations in your mind or empathy and reading of others thoughts. Just like a radio picks up an electromagnetic wave, the brain too acts as a radio receiver and sender, picking up other peoples brain waves assumably in the radio-microwave frequency bandwidth. Emotions at least were shown to be in the radio bandwith I believe.</p> 
 
<p>Focus directs the brains electromagnetic force. Hence focus on an area of the body stimulates blood flow and allows control over it like when tensing the muscles. Focus outside of the body projects an energy that can cause a feint blue radiance to form around an object that you hold strong focus on. This corona discharge like effect is a subtle etheric energy from your mental energy.</p>
 
<p>Electromagnetism already has been able to convert to fire with ionizing sparks and air with high voltage lifter bladeless fan experiments. Hypothetically it is possible through strong magnetism to convert it to the water and earth element. Is it possible for a human to replicate this, creating strong voltages that make sparks or air currents? This can be thought of as magic.</p>
 
<p>The soul then hypothetically is of electromagnetic nature(Or a more refined form), that rests in the brain during life and flies out of it at death as I've seen from some animals. The human has a more developed soul and brain, being part divine as is said compared to an animal whose brain and soul is far simpler than the humans. Maybe you could transplant a human brain into an animal or vice versa. Maybe even develop the animals brain until it becomes like a human to create humanoid animals. Similarly, artificial souls could hypothetically be made and transported to a flesh body. But I'll leave things here.</p>
  <br>
<h4>21/4/23</h4>
 
<p>Reishii mushroom works well as an anti viral to get rid of sickness symptoms.</p>
  <br>
<h4>22/4/23</h4>
 
<p>I spoke to someone who told me they can't read or write. That gave me a lot of perspective to the kinds of people in the world and the lives they live. To use computers, write and read is like a super power to some others.</p>
  <br>
<p>Paper supposedly can be made by boiling plants in lye, mashing them and spreading it thin across frames.</p>
  <br>
<p>So then heating herbs in lye probably leaves just the fibres as a physical byproduct.</p>
  <br>
<h4>24/4/23</h4>
 
<p>Battery - 32700, 21700</p> 
  <br>
<p>I can now see with twitter that the whole lgbt thing is a psy-op that weeds out the weak, vulnerable and naive. The same happened on 4chan.</p>
  <br>
<p>Maybe putting weights on a sprocket like a fly wheel would increase performance.</p>
  <br>
<h4>25/4/23</h4>
 
<p>The legs might be like batteries in the body. Focusing on them charges up your stamina and the stronger your legs, the better your stamina.</p>
