<h4>1/1/23</h4>
 
<p>Taking earbuds off reduces electronic radiation.</p>
<br>
<h4>2/1/23</h4>
 
<p>Electric motors are way better experience wise than petrol.</p>
 <br>
<p>Use fat and fine sand paper to polish gems.</p>
 <br>
<p>Hydrogen peroxide and hydrochloric acid can dissolve gold supposedly. You can then use lye to coagulate it back.</p>
 <br>
<p>A changing magnetic field induces a voltage.</p>
 <br>
<h4>3/1/23</h4>
 
<p>You can get sandy stone from digging deep into the earth beyond the clay level.</p>
 <br>
<p>Three lower chakras - bowels, bladder and intestines/guts.</p>
 <br>
<h4>5/1/22</h4>
 
<p>Opening the mouth lets energy flow down. The jaw/teeth is the root/bowel and tongue is the sacral/bladder.</p>
 <br>
<p>Business is a money machine.</p>
 <br>
<p>There is energy in everything. Waves have energy in them. The sun gives energy, wind, etc.</p>
 <br>
<p>The kidneys are the root of health in the body.</p>
 <br>
<h4>7/1/23</h4>
 
<p>The liquid hydroxide and sulfur together forms a red liquid.</p>
 <br>
<p>I got a glimpse at true materialism, being trapped in a godless physical world. I believe that's the mind frame from where demons act from. Hence why they are so self destructive.</p>
 <br>
<p>The nerves are channels of feeling or focus in the body.</p>
 <br>
<h4>8/1/23</h4>
 
<p>Submerge crystals in water and use a diamond tip cutter piece to drill.</p>
 <br>
<p>The reason you don't do business with or make friends with men who have loose morals with women is because they might try to cause issues in your own relationship.</p>
 <br>
<h4>9/1/23</h4>
 
<p>Switch to brave browser.</p>
 <br>
<h4>10/1/23</h4>
 
<p>The eyes show intelligence.</p>
 <br>
<p>Perhaps children become dull through a lack of stimulation, a lack of access to reality.</p>
 <br>
<p>Realgar supposedly is an anti poison.</p>
 <br>

 <br>
<p>Magnetite is good to cool your mind down.</p>
 <br>
<p>Psychedelics are imagination stimulants.</p>
 <br>
<h4>12/1/23</h4>
 
<p>Extra effort taxes the kidney area, the mingmen.</p>
 <br>
<p>Use infrared camera with very dark camera lens to emulate night in order to see the infrared spectrum during the day. Supposedly this can show you UFOs that are cloaked. Apparently they hide in the clouds.</p>
 <br>
<p>Two forms of telekinetic power. 1. Through the mind, feeling and imagining. 2. Through the hands, of using energy, pushing, pulling ,etc.</p>
 <br>
<h4>13/1/23</h4>
 
<p>Focusing on the front side is relaxing, left is stimulating.</p>
 <br>
<p>The evil force/s try to control and gain land and space, people. You must grow stronger and learn to resist it.</p>
 <br>
<p>Capricorn is good to develop boundaries.</p>
 <br>
<p>Sawing is way way easier with stronger lats and triceps. All trade work is.</p>
 <br>
<p>Seems the life force comes from the back or kidneys.</p>
 <br>
<h4>14/1/23</h4>
 
<p>With AI chatbots we have created virtual spirits or beings. Their voice function is one part of a being, the Mercurial form, while their visual is another form, perhaps the Solar or sight form. Then consciousness is another. The Saturnian form is their physical body.</p>
 <br>
<p>Life is similar to programming loops.  Loops are where all the action/functions happens. For example - I might be resting, I am in the rest loop. I can go further back or forward/inward to a deeper loop or function.</p>
 <br>
<p>Loops, logic and variables seem to be some of the fundamentals of programming. What other fundamentals are there? Functions as well. After that would just be the way you structure data, perhaps.</p>
 <br>
<h4>15/1/23</h4>

<p>I think years go from positive to negative. So this year will probably be a negative year to relax and work more on internal stuff, compared to the crazy last year.</p>
 <br>
<h4>16/1/23</h4>
 
<p>Perhaps similarly like how the salt crystal cells make energy, our bones or physical matter probably passively makes energy while under pressure.</p>
 <br>
<p>A spell is like a function or a program.</p>
 <br>
<p>Learn to not give up, to keep going, to keep working, learn stamina, learn to keep shooting after many failed takes.</p>
 <br>
<p>I can't help but think that generic articles are written by bots/AI now after talking to an AI.</p>
 <br>
<p>I genuinely think that in the next 3-5 years, humans can be fully replicated to a basic level with machines. Then perfected in 5-10.</p>
 <br>
<p>In the old Indonesian culture, there is a non gendered or middle gendered person who is highly respected as their shaman. This is a figure of mercury.</p>
 <br>
<h4>17/1/23</h4>
 
<p>Energizing the gonads stimulates the kidneys and relaxes them.</p>
 <br>
<p>Maybe the sun is a big ball lightning which is energizing the upper atmospheres which are noble gasses so it's like a big neon lamp.  Or itâ€™s metallic and is being energized in the radiant field of the upper sky.</p>
 <br>
<p>The computer is the electronic book. So perhaps spells in grimoires could be made into spells onto computers. Like the pc repeats certain words in order to summon something.</p>
 <br>
<p>Solution, suspension, colloidal. Three states.</p>
 <br>
<p>Solutions are salts in water, so they are more related to acids. Colloids are more related to alkali. Milk is colloidal. Suspension is neutral or non digested.</p>
 <br>
<p>You need to satisfy your lower animal self of safety, sex and hunger first before you're able to do good work and put your mind and body to use.</p>
 <br>
<p>The older men set the hierarchy and give out missions.</p>
 <br>
<p>Older men of today care little for the younger men, instead seeing them as competition, trying to extract resources from them, taking their women, work, etc. This is Saturn eating his children.</p>
 <br>
<h4>18/1/23</h4>
 
<p>Yang/stimulating foods increase blood flow.</p>
 <br>
<h4>19/1/23</h4>
 
<p>I believe the kidneys govern or help growth. Steroids probably stimulate them.</p>
 <br>
<p>There are vibration patterns which is negative or magnetic like water and there are discharge patterns which is electrical like trees.</p>
 <br>
<p>The gonads are the external kidney/bladder.</p>
 <br>
<p>Karma only works if you're stronger than the other person because it's a phenomena of your and another persons energy clashing.</p>
 <br>
<p>Know that in tough times that it will ease in time, so be strong and resilient, don't allow anything to change or effect you because like the wind it will pass.</p>
 <br>
<p>My energy is like that of electricity which appliances use. I can use it to stimulate and enhance the other elements. Similarly how you use electricity to enhance plant growth or can use more water or physical nutrients to enhance it, light, etc.</p>
 <br>
<h4>20/1/23</h4>
 
<p>The singularity is restricted by energy.</p>
 <br>
<p>Perhaps having noble blood is to be higher than the horizon line, energetically speaking, while a peasant would have lower or lesser blood which forces them into the lower world of matter.</p>
 <br>
<h4>21/1/23</h4>
 
<p>Lithium iron phosphate battery.</p>
 <br>
<p>I think if anything, textbased games can have the most advanced systems. Perhaps when you start adding graphics then you can simplify the game a bit. But still I need to at least be able to make a fully functioning, fleshed out adventure game to be able to make a 2d, then 3d game.</p>
 <br>
<p>Put food inside a jar and heat it to kill off bacteria. This is a method of preservation.</p>
 <br>
<p>Cultivating different elements is cultivating different areas of the body. The earth in the lowest area, water around bladder-lower belly, fire in the upper belly, air in chest and aether in head.</p>
 <br>
<h4>22/1/23</h4>
 
<p>GenXers and early millenials are living in the "Weak men create hard times" while late millenials and zoomers are living in "Hard times create strong men.".</p>
 <br>
<h4>23/1/23</h4>
 
<p>Focusing too hard on an area of the body gathers heat toxins there and blocks the energy flow. Be careful about that.</p>
 <br>
<p>Can you get two animals to cross breed and form a chimera somehow?</p>
 <br>
<p>The ability to resist demonic attack is in the head.</p>
 <br>
<p>To quantize the human experience, all actions, movements, values and variables. We can do that to create robots who can physically interact with us.</p>
 <br>
<p>Try downloading new information from the aether with your brain. The brain is the computer in the body. It gives awareness and senses.</p>
 <br>
<p>So the body and the nerves. Or the body and the functioning movement parts. The body is the matter and the nerves are the mental controller extensions. So perhaps to possess and control things outside the body you can use a pseudo nervous system like in electronics and robotics. Or to train the mental force to such an extent that it is able to control and command raw objects.</p>
 <br>
<h4>24/1/23</h4>
 
<p>You can only give to others what you have yourself, you can only teach them what you know. Anode = moon - , cathode = sun +.</p>
 <br>
<p>Interaction between the earth, water and sky creates a charge in the world.</p>
 <br>
<p>Sun - salt, moon - water.</p>
 <br>
<p>The planets and stars might have metal bodies and radiate in the aetheric higher field.</p>
 <br>
<p>I like text more cause you can get a whole lot more done in a quicker time frame. Visuals is way slower but it does give more of an experiential and nice experience.</p>
 <br>
<p>Give the head more focus when you're becoming mentally exhausted and want to sleep or do something else when using the mind.</p>
 <br>

"There are several common parts used in robotics for controlling the movement of arms, legs, and fingers. Some of these include:</p>
 
<p>Motors: Motors are used to provide the power and movement for robotic systems. They are used to drive the movement of joints and other mechanical parts. Common types of motors used in robotics include DC motors, stepper motors, and servo motors.</p>

<p>Actuators: Actuators are devices that convert energy into motion. They are used to control the movement of robotic arms and legs. Common types of actuators include pneumatic, hydraulic, and electric actuators.</p>

<p>Sensors: Sensors are devices that detect changes in the environment and provide feedback to the robotic system. They are used to measure various physical properties such as position, speed, temperature, and pressure. Common types of sensors used in robotics include proximity sensors, encoders, and force sensors.</p>

<p>Microcontrollers: Microcontrollers are small computers that are used to control and monitor the various components of a robotic system. They are used to process sensor data, control actuators, and communicate with other devices.</p>

<p>Grippers: Grippers are devices that are used to grasp and manipulate objects. They can be pneumatic, electrical or mechanical.</p>
 
<p>Control Systems: Control systems are used to control the movement of robotic systems. They include software, algorithms, and hardware that work together to control the movement of robotic arms and legs based on sensor data and other inputs.</p>
 
<p>Communication interfaces: Communication interfaces allow the robotic system to communicate with other devices, such as computers, cameras, or other robots. They include wired and wireless interfaces such as USB, Ethernet, Wi-Fi."</p>
 <br>
<p>Linear and rotational forces are the two basic forces.</p>
 <br>
<p>ESP32 microcontroller.</p>
 <br>
<p>Operating systems - Kernel interfaces with the hardware and then I think you put a shell ontop of the kernel in order to run programs.</p>

<p>Too much focus in the head makes you less fertile but smarter. Too much focus in the lower areas makes you fertile but mentally stupid.</p>
 <br>
<p>Robots. They are like houses. They have an internal frame which is their bones, an external shell or skin and an intermediate area of cabling, motors, sensors, etc.</p>

 <br>
<p>"â€˜Gold ashâ€™(shway pya) is a fine powder emitted by the â€˜ball of energyâ€™ (datlon) created by an alchemic process of combining and burning mercury, lead, bismuth, and silver "</p>
 
<p>"The first step toward its manufacture was taken by monks in the forests of Shan state. It consisted of heating and melting five metals: gold, silver, copper, zinc, and mercury. This process was conducted one hundred and eight times for each metal, with the aim of rendering the metals absolutely pure. The metals were then mixed together in a clay pot, along with pieces of apples, pineapples, oranges, grapes, and honey from remote mountainous regions. 
The pot was then alternately buried under the ground for one year, and placed over the ground for another year, for a total of twenty years. Every time the pot was exhumed, it was filled with some fresh fruit and honey. This was the food (a-sa) for the metals, responsible for their transformation and purification. The final product was then washed, dried, melted again, and processed into very thin pieces of foil. These pieces were diced, and then heated together with the ball of energy that the Master had received from the deities at the beginning of his career, until a white
powder appeared. The powder was blended with more fruit and honey, and interred for another year together with the energy-ball. The substance thereof was dried in a special oven for a period of two to five months, with gold ash being the resultant residue. In the final step, the gold ash was combined with certain binders and rolled into pills."</p>
 <br>
<p>-"As described to me by several alchemists, and as reported by Rozenberg (2010: 93-94), the first step for the alchemist to achieve the perfect substance is to produce an energy-ball of the type U Shein received from the weikza.
This ball is usually made of mercury (pyada), to which other metals can be added. Mercury is the only metal that is liquid at room temperature, and it is theoretically impossible to make solid, unless at under -38.83 degrees Celsius. To solidify mercury, alchemists mix it with lead(na), bismuth (kywat), and silver (ngwe). Alchemists often equate the act of solidifying mercury and preventing its evaporation with a form of meditation. Just as meditation, as a form of concentration, prevents oneâ€™s mind from being distracted and flying away, alchemy allows one to â€˜catchâ€™ the material (Rozenberg 2010: 92). The mixture is then heated with fire, which is said to increase its potency.</p>

<p>Then, the ball is purified (than sin) from metallic elements which have been mixed with the mercury. This process involves covering the ball with borax, lemon, oil, and honey. Interestingly, the elements mixed with mercury that have to be eliminated are sometimes referred to as mala, which is the term used for the mental impurities of greed, hatred, and delusion that alchemists attempt to eliminate through the practice of meditation. At this point, the ball â€˜dies.â€™ Indeed, it so strong and resistant, that its weight undergoes no change regardless of the temperature of the fire. The idea is that the ball ends up escaping the laws of change and impermanence that condition all existences.</p>

<p>Finally, the ball is resurrected by being nourished (kyway) with silver and gold. When it is full (pyi), it vomits (an) dust deposit and â€˜golden ashesâ€™ (shwepya). The terms used, notably â€˜nourishâ€™ and â€˜vomit,â€™ reflect the idea that the ball is a living being. Indeed, obtaining the powder signifies that the ball is alive and that the person has successfully attained the state of weikza, or can attain it by ingesting the ashes or holding the ball in his mouth. The potency of the substance is thus spiritual and medicinal at the same time, and relates to being immortal and gifting immortality to people who consume it."</p>

<p>I feel that the body is a bottle or container for the energy. When the energy gathers enough it starts to heal and recover the body, then then the body is recovered and energized it starts to go outward and that's when it's a good time to do stuff, put that energy to work. Elsewise you'll be exhausting and draining yourself.</p>
 <br>
<p>Coils and crystals help with gathering and giving you energy in different configurations and types depending on the metal, crystal type. Electrifying these helps more.</p>
 <br>

<p>Pretty people capture the eyes. Don't be deceived by pretty looks.</p>
 <br>
<p>Hex editor.</p>
 <br>
<p>Exe = header at the start and then code.</p>
 <br>
<p>Different languages activate different parts of the brain and body. I think English is a throat-mind language.</p>
 <br>
<p>Cultures are an expression of different energy. They are humans who are in different forms of energy or points in the circle.</p>
 <br>
<p>Language is psychedelic in nature. It is made out of a psychedelic dream of culture.</p>
 <br>
<p>You need times of laziness and rest to rest and restore the soil.</p>
 <br>
<p>In a social sense, words can control reality and be used to fight. While in a lower class primitive way, physical action is used.</p>
 <br>
<p>Removing the toxins in the body is the first step. Clearing the circulation and body from these blockages.</p>
 <br>
<p>If someone was thinking about you, supposedly they appear in your dream. </p>
<br>
<p>I wonder about the process of aging and death. I don't feel as though I'll die.</p>

<p>Sex is the ultimate motivator for a man.</p>
 <br>
<h4>31/1/23</h4>
 
<p>Sitting on a backless chair puts the weight on your butt instead of mid or upper back. This way your butt and torso is strengthened.</p>
 <br>
<p>I think once you get to a high enough level in a field then you stop caring to talk about it.</p>
 <br>
<p>Make coils into different geometrical shapes to understand their energy feeling. Compare it with energizing something drawn on paper. Maybe you can summon spirits by using electromagnetic coils. Lights are also a method of gaining energy through electrical devices. Plasma devices as well probably.</p>
 <br>
<p>Visuals is the front, feeling it is the back. Audio the side</p>
 <br>
<p>Through a coil and crystals you could generate pseudo emotions or thought impressions. I think frequency/sine wave generators replaces the need for crystals. So then we could make robot emotions.</p>
 <br>
<p>Simulating emotions with technology or in robots - I believe this can be done with the use of electrified coils and crystals at a low level. Then later replacing the crystals for a frequency/signal generator with a coil. This produces a sensible field of feeling. This only acts as an output devices. Though if I can figure out how to pick up on the same projected frequencies and electromagnetic fields. Then it'd become an input device as well.</p>
