<h4>1/8/23</h4>
 
<p>LK-99 recipes - 1.Lead oxide + lead sulfate, heat for 24 hours at 725c to make lanerkite. 2. Mix phosphorus 1 part and copper 3 part in a vacuum tube, heat at 550 to make copper phosphide. For 48 hours. 3. Mix both parts and heat at 925c for 5-20 hours in a vacuum.</p>
 <br>
<p>So mixing materials and heating them in a vacuum can make meta materials.</p>
 <br>
<p>The back of the body and the lower part of the body is the shadow or unconscious side/parts. Developing these muscles gives you control over the material world. </p>
 <br>
<p>Instead of reading, you could be doing. Social media is good because you can compress huge amounts of knowledge into short text are share it with others. Not to say there is no value to spending hours reading, in fact it can be very helpful. Just don't get lost in the library when you should be doing something or when action will get you the results you want.</p>
<br>
<h4>2/8/23</h4>
 
<p>The main rewards of your work are the results you get. The side rewards are that of the skills and experiences you get along the way.</p>
 <br>
<p>Watt hours of a battery is volts * amps. Watts used of an appliance is volts * amps per hour. So power taken from a battery or power source is the watts/hour of an appliance negated from the watt hour of the power source per hour.</p>
 <br>
<h4>3/8/23</h4>
 
<p>Anything which isn't done from the ground, the most stable point of you wont last or work well. Similarly a group is weighed down by its worst member.</p>
 <br>
<h4>5/8/23</h4>
 
<p>Nickel iron with potassium hydroxide. An Edison battery.</p>
 <br>
<p>Sanding an aluminum can isn't good enough to remove the plastic.</p>
 <br>
<h4>7/8/23</h4>
 
<p>I imagine the wisdom teeth relate to the developing of the outer and last pathways in the body. Supposedly Africans develop theirs in younger ages and Japanese in older ages which aligns with the growth rate of races.</p>
<br>
<h4>8/8/23</h4>
 
<p>Yang herbs - ginseng, gingko biloba, and horny goat weed, maca, tribulus, fennugreek</p>
 <br>
<p>Yin herbs -  Rehmannia, dongquai, wild yam root, damiana, astragalus, hehsou</p>
 <br>
<p>Constantly upgrade yourself in the cycle of life</p>
<br>
<h4>10/8/23</h4>
 
<p>Radios, visual, sonar, all this stuff might be military tech originally, internet too.</p>
 <br>
<p>Crystal paste electrolyte.</p>
 <br>
<p>The electrolyte salts might help to hold the amperage.</p>
 <br>
<h4>11/8/23</h4>
 
<p>Electronic technology is related to the head, brain and sensory faculties. Audio/visual technology for example. So then assumably magic is done with the mind and mental energy.</p>
 <br>
<h4>12/8/23</h4>
 
<p>Supposedly time and space can be altered or influenced by magnetic fields. Might not be space time but aether. Perhaps the sun and moon can be altered and changed, be made to hold still.</p>
 <br>
<p>When young we have imagination and passion and when old we have skills and ability but can lack the previous characteristics.</p>
 <br>
<p>When you work with chemicals like minerals, salts, acids, etc you start to gain an intuition, a psychic understanding of them. People forget that chemistry, and science in general is first most a practical art like cooking. You may take interest in certain chemicals, find that they are similar to your nature and always use them in your experiments.</p>
 <br>
<p>Word related tasks stress the throat. Programming, language, writing, etc. Make sure to give your throat and the back spinal area a rest if you do too much of this work.</p>
 <br>
<h4>15/8/23</h4>
 
<p>The heart is the master center of feeling. Might be why the spiritual people focus on it. I think we can do magic by using the heart and the feeling from it. Our feeling might be related to the hearts EM field. If you feel too much you overtax the heart. The head is related to imagination, so a higher occultic or spiritual area. The head relates to vision too.</p>
 <br>
<h4>18/8/23</h4>
 
<p>Breathing is one way to get more vital energy.</p>
 <br>
<h4>19/8/23</h4>
 
<p>First world countries send their manufacturing and resource harvesting over to third world countries while third world countries send their men to first world countries to work jobs and harvest money.</p>
 <br>
<p>I imagine once the money in the first world countries runs dry and there aren't enough social programs and jobs that these immigrants will probably run back home. Just imagine a mosquito or parasite.</p>
 <br>
<p>Compost piles are organic bins. They emanate volatile life energy. You could make piles of organic and waste material to fertilize land.</p>
 <br>
<h4>21/8/23</h4>
 
<p>With the body and organs there are excess uses of them which cause deficiencies of their fluids and energies and also a lack of use which causes an atrophy, makes them smaller, weaker and less functional if not used over time.</p>
 <br>
<p>Charles Steinmetz, Heavyside, Walter Russel for electrical science.</p>
 <br>
<h4>22/8/23</h4>
 
<p>Birth charts are the code for our characters.</p>
 <br>
<h4>23/8/23</h4>
 
<p>Crystals seem to grow in a matrix or earthly material area. Additions of moisture, heat, underground vapors and other factors may aid or create this growth.</p>
 <br>
<h4>24/8/23</h4>
 
<p>A will to survive is the key to life.</p>
 <br>
<p>Wearing copper gives you a calm, cool feeling of water.</p>
 <br>
<p>Supposedly wrapping coils around different materials makes energy.</p>
 <br>
<p>People gain demi-god like abilities and energy from others following them. This happens online and some let it get to their head.</p>
 <br>
<h4>25/8/23</h4>
 
<p>Positive side to antenna and negative to ground.</p>
 <br>
<h4>26/8/23</h4>
 
<p>"In electronics, a "ground" reference serves as a point of zero voltage, against which all other voltage levels in the circuit are measured. It's like a point of comparison that helps in understanding how much potential difference exists between various points in the circuit." -GPT</p>
 <br>
<p>"AC (alternating current) is a form of electricity in which the direction of the current periodically reverses. In a typical AC power system, the voltage and current change direction at a specific frequency, usually 50 or 60 Hz. This means that the flow of electrons alternates back and forth, creating a sinusoidal waveform." -GPT</p>
 <br>
<p>"When you short-circuit a battery, you're essentially creating a direct path for the current to flow without any resistance. This causes a very high current to flow through the circuit, which leads to excessive heating of the wires and can even damage the battery and other components." -GPT</p>
 <br>
<h4>27/8/23</h4>
 
<p>Vibration, magnetism, static, pressure, electrical stimulation.</p>
 <br>
<h4>29/8/23</h4>
 
<p>EMF is analogous to heat I think. Heat is produced usually from high amperage short circuiting and I think a lot of emf from high voltage?
So then light might be in the middle? And sound might be lower as a more kinetic thing.</p>
 <br>
<p>Mica is a very energizing material. Supposedly they coated the metals to conduct.</p>
 <br>
<p>Mica can be used to make electrostatic capacitors supposedly.</p>
 <br>
<h4>30/8/23</h4>
 
<p>Seems that no one wants to take responsibility for their actions or life or anything these days.</p>
 <br>
<p>Books and other - Charles Proteus Steinmetz - electric discharges, waves and impulses. JJ Thomson - Electricity and matter</p>
 <br>
<p>Women are not evil or bad. But a woman who IS evil usually isn't disciplined and restricted by society or culture, hence why bad woman are dangerous.
Similarly a man who does not restrain his emotions and uses physical or other violence becomes dangerous because he can cause real damage. But he is usually quickly restrained by society.</p>
 <br>
<h4>31/8/23</h4>
 
<p>Solar powered emf or solar powered antenna for agriculture.</p>
