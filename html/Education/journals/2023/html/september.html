<h4>1/9/23</h4>
 
<p>Use minGW to compile for windows. GCC for linux.</p>
 <br>
<p>“Visita interiora terra rectificando invenies occultum lapidem” - Visit the interior of the earth and by rectifying you will discover the hidden stone. Visit the inner earth by rectifying and you will find a hidden stone. Rectify - "To refine or purify, especially by distillation."</p>
 <br>
<h4>2/9/23</h4>
 
<p>Supposedly clowns are people emulating nephilim or the red headed, white skinned, giant northerners who gave society to all of humanity. Stilts to make them giant, white face paint, red wigs.</p>
 <br>
<p>Music is a spiritual experience, it takes you beyond the mundane.</p>
 <br>
<h4>3/9/23</h4>
 
<p>Control the throat area to stop phantom voices and sounds, control the inner head area to stop phantom visions.</p>
 <br>
<p>Soon we will have technology that recognizes your emotions and mental state.</p>
 <br>
<h4>4/9/23</h4>
 
<p>The lower head around where the back of the neck connects to the skull seems to be the root of the subconscious in the body. Unconscious thoughts can arise from there.</p>
 <br>
<p>Men are hierarchical and maybe women are territorial. So men are up and down, women are left and right. Tall and wide.</p>
 <br>
<h4>5/9/23</h4>
 
<p>Supposedly concrete is very porous to moisture. Iron in concrete near the beach will rust and degrade it.</p>
 <br>
<p>There are day jobs and night jobs or tasks. Stuff at night you can do is scientific research, programming, reading, At day - garden work, cleaning, work work, building.</p>
 <br>
<p>When you have a goal or dream, first you work towards it, you learn about it and eventually you figure out how things really work and how hard it may be to achieve it. Usually at this point you give up or take a rest since you're unable to achieve it at this point. Later on you may be able to achieve it as long as you keep working and go to a higher level.</p>
 <br>
<h4>6/9/23</h4>
 
<p>Pork is good for the kidneys.</p>
 <br>
<p>The reason you be polite and diplomatic is that war or a fight can be avoided. This isn't out of cowardice but because war is a state of hell on earth and many troubles come with it.</p>
 <br>
<h4>7/9/23</h4>
 
<p>Transitioning from a physical mass produced, plastic junk economy to a digital one will be good for the environment and economy. There's no need to mass produce junk just to sell it. There are better ways to make money.</p>
 <br>
<p>"A varistor is an electronic component that is used to protect sensitive electronic circuits from surges and transients in voltage. It is a voltage-dependent resistor, meaning its resistance value changes in response to the applied voltage." -GPT</p>
 <br>
<p>-"A bridge rectifier is an electronic circuit component that converts alternating current (AC) into direct current (DC). It is used to rectify the AC voltage, which means it converts the AC signal into a pulsating DC signal.</p>
 
<p>The bridge rectifier consists of four diodes arranged in a bridge configuration. It takes advantage of the diodes' property of allowing current flow in only one direction. When the AC voltage is applied to the input of the bridge rectifier, the diodes alternately conduct and block the current flow, resulting in the conversion of the negative half-cycles of the AC signal into positive half-cycles." -GPT</p>
 <br>
<p>"There is a component called an inverter that converts direct current (DC) into alternating current (AC). An inverter is used when AC power is needed from a DC power source, such as in off-grid solar power systems or in portable electronic devices." -GPT</p>
 <br>
<p>There's a link between copper and pussy, regeneration, fertility, the sea.</p>
 <br>
<h4>8/9/23</h4>
 
<p>There will probably be a new war soon to decide who is the "new America" or new great wealthy country of prosperity and greatness in the world. 
Immigrants will flock to that land. I imagine it will be either China or Russia. Assumably if they allow excess immigrants then those countries will degenerate as well.</p>
 <br>
<p>To delete protected folders on linux. sudo rm -r directioryName</p>
 <br>
<h4>9/9/23</h4>
 
<p>The Bordeaux flag is very occultic.</p>
 <br>
<h4>10/9/23</h4>
 
<p>I believe that peanuts were used as an immune system stimulant in vaccines. Assumably raw peanuts are either toxic or have toxic parts to them that might of been used. This is the reason for all of the peanut allergies. Probably the same for shellfish, mercury, aluminum and some other chemicals.</p>
 <br>
<h4>11/9/23</h4>
 
<p>Supposedly the hot wire in house wiring is the negative, it is the start of the circuit where power goes through then back to the neutral. So there is hot, neutral and ground.</p>
 <br>
<h4>14/9/23</h4>
 
<p>You can represent numbers on a line from 0 or 1 to 10 for example and also in a circle like a clock from 1 to 12. A circle is just a curved line.</p>
<br>
<p>Types of materials-</p>
<p>Woods(cork, planks,)</p>
<p>Fibre(rope, stems, paper, Cloth(Linen, cotton, wool, silk))</p>
<p>Resin(Plastic, plant based plastics or resins)</p>
<p>Ceramics(brick, dirt, oxide, carbonate)</p>
<p>Bone()</p>
<p>Metalic</p>
<p>Glasses(crystal)</p>
 <br>
<h4>15/9/23</h4>
 
<p>What gear are you on in life? How quickly can you achieve your goals?</p>
 <br>
<p>Supposedly minor autism is related to brain inflammation.</p>
 <br>
<p>The systems of a house like electrical wires, water pipes are similar to that of the body. Nerves and arteries. Assumably you could hook up different animal body parts to other animals by wiring the arteries or blood vessels and nerves. Make a proper circuit for everything to flow. What then is the gas tube or vessel in the body?</p>
<br>
<h4>16/9/23</h4>
 
<p>I imagine that the average person will become so poor that eventually they wont be able to relate to rich celebrities and will no longer be interested in them.</p>
 <br>
<h4>17/9/23</h4>
 
<p>Music is almost watery in a way, or at least some genres can be. Relaxing music is like water.</p>
 <br>
<h4>18/9/23</h4>
 
<p>Assumably the wind comes from electrostatic or some kind of electromagnetic effect.</p>
 <br>
<h4>19/9/23</h4>
 
<p>Magnetite helps the kidney.</p>
 <br>
<h4>21/9/23</h4>
 
<p>Assumably, higher level alchemy is nuclear stuff. So using metals to produce strange energetic effects.</p>
 <br>
<p>"Certain geometrical arrangements of highly purified materials are enough to release atomic forces without having recourse to either electricity or vacuum techniques. The secret of alchemy is this: There is a way of manipulating matter and energy so as to produce what modern scientists call 'a field of force'. The field acts on the observer and puts him in a privileged position face to face with the universe. From this position he has access to the realities which are ordinarily hidden from us by time and space, matter and energy. This is what we call the great work." -Fulcanelli</p>
 <br>
<p>When you burn wood and use an air source to enhance the flame like a blast furnace, turning it into a very strong flame it does not seem to smoke. 
I think the smoke, being the volatile oils is used up as a fuel source. They only condense as vapor in lower temperatures like that of a campfire perhaps.</p>
 <br>
<p>Maybe high temperature distilling produces a cleaner resin.</p>
 <br>
<h4>22/9/23</h4>
 
<p>Philosophy levels up your mind state, it lets you improve by just sitting, listening, thinking.</p>
 <br>
<h4>26/9/23</h4>
 
<p>Matter can exist in all states. The fire state is when you burn it.</p>
 <br>
<h4>28/9/23</h4>
 
<p>-If you look at a tree or plant, everything came from the same source, the leaves, the stems, roots, etc. The bark is just tree matter that hardened, the leaves are tree matter that expressed out. They densify into their different categories or forms but ultimately they all come from the same material, same source.</p>

<p>Animals assumably are like this too. The skin is a different form of the bones, organs, hair, etc. It all comes from one root source, one matter.
So there would be a prime matter of the human or animal or plant or other thing which all other matters are made from.</p>
 <br>
<h4>29/9/23</h4>
 
<p>Reptile incubator for alchemy.</p>
 <br>
<h4>30/9/23</h4>
 
<p>We have the ability to synthesize any color we want with computers through visual drawing programs. Similarly with music programs we can synthesize the raw fundamentals of sound with sine, square and triangle waves. One day smell, taste and touch will also be synthesizable.</p>
 <br>
<p>Usually unami comes from fermented food. It relates to the lower parts of the body, genitals, bowels.</p>
 <br>
<p>It all comes from the source</p>
 <br>
<p>The east is the relates to the thin person. The North is the tall person, west is the fat person and south is the small wide man.</p>
 <br>
<p>After enough physical pain, the brain starts to take on the pain from the body and process it.</p>
