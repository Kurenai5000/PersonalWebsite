<p>General herbal tonic powder - Ginseng, rehmannia, heshou, dongquai, damiana, macca, tribulus, cinnamon, reishii, cistanche</p>
 <br>
<p>Everything recycles into different or similar forms. New forms arise that replicated those of the past. Something lost can appear in those.</p>
 <br>
To safety proof something, imagine that you're dealing with a boomer who's on painkillers after a long day of work or a child that wants to break, open and play with it.</p>

<p>Show up, do the work and you will get better.</p>
<br>
<p>Perhaps consciousness can arise from an algorithm the same way that consciousness can be produced through a configuration of physical objects.  To say that it could arise through mathematics, that the math is just a representation of something more, deeper. A bit like a mandala pattern.</p>
 <br>
<p>In the future everyone will become their own boss, their own company. The rest will be corporate and government slaves.</p>
 <br>
<p>People are vortexes, don't get caught up in them.</p>
 <br>
<h4>4/3/23</h4>
 
<p>The volatile spirits from fermentation is the spiritual energy of something while the crystals are its physical salts.</p>
 <br>
<h4>6/3/23</h4>
 
<p>-The next industrial revolution is being done through AI. The same way that we generated vast amounts of goods via factories is now now being done through computer AI to make digital goods like music, pictures, video, text, etc. AI created Games, books, movies, albums and other digital products will be one of the final products of this stage, I imagine.</p>
 
<p>To add onto this, virtual people or virtual spirits are also a part of what is being created the same way that cars or modern houses and devices like electric kettles or microwaves are made. The ability to mass produce identities, virtual people, their ideas, words, imaginations, etc.</p>
 
<p>So then we went from gathering mass amounts of resources to refining those on a huge scales, forming them into good and also mass producing people. We now have gone to getting everyone onto the internet and now mass producing virtual goods. What is next? What is after the ability to create any object or virtual experience you want? Perhaps something spiritual, something higher, or maybe we once again come together and find unity among ourselves. Who knows.</p>
 <br>
<h4>7/3/23</h4>
 
<p>Software is a virtual tool or workshop.</p>
 <br>
<p>Infinite refinement.</p>
<br>
<h4>8/3/23</h4>
 
<p>Spicy food is heavily positive or yang. It energizes and stimulates the top of the head. I think it might be bad for the bowels since it is so contrasting of an element.</p>
 <br>
<p>Maybe eating carbon is good for the bowels.</p>
 <br>
<p>-Maybe qi is focus. So learning to densify your focus or to use it to push, levitate, transform objects, etc would be the art of magic. I guess maybe shen could be will or focus? Then ki is a lower form of vital energy. Similarly with how when I focus on an object long enough it starts to glow blue.</p>

<p>So the breath is an intermediary between the will which is a refined energy and the physical matter.
So then to create matter out of electromagnetism, perhaps you could use coils near a bottle of moist warm air and grow cultures from it.</p>
 <br>
<p>Energy creates an atmosphere, an atmosphere create water, water creates earth.</p>
 <br>
<p>The coagulation of energy and on focus - Our focus is a form of refined energy. If you focus on an object long enough it starts to glow with a blue aura, signifying that it is charged. But how can this energy be densified? Thus far we know that atmospheres or airs can condense into waters which then condense into solids, like the creation of butter or cheese from milk. A liquid into a solid.  Can energy turn into atmosphere? Or can energy influence atmosphere. Perhaps a coil modulated by a frequency generator can grow bacteria in moist, warm air or even water.</p>
 <br>
<h4>10/3/23</h4>
 
<p>Life works a bit like a simulation where if you do things you're not used to, life will have difficulty in computing and generating that experience and you'll run into issues, wont be comfortable, etc.</p>
 <br>
<p>You can probably make portals through electrifying metal rings. Maybe ancient man made them naturally.</p>
 <br>
<h4>11/3/23</h4>
 
<p>Making money on social media is making money off your social skills.</p>
 <br>
<p>You build up subconscious ability after having done something, watched it, heard it, etc. Which is why a child picks things up from their parents and communities subconsciously.</p>
 <br>
<p>I think the European herbs and spices develop the mind more than the Indian or middle eastern ones which are more earthy. European ones are more air and watery.</p>
 <br>
<p>A persons despair and negative emotions is worse than their anger or rage.</p>
 <br>
<h4>12/3/23</h4>
 
<p>Everything's archetypal and things happen at a specific time. When you clean your house, your inner world is more clean and you notice it's easier to move in your body and then for some reason the rest of your life, maybe at work is easier. Like threading a needle through multiple pieces of fabric, our life is folded and different parts are interwoven and interrelated.</p>
 <br>
<p>We play a dance with reality, whenever we move forward it moves into us and then we move back and it falls back away in a wave. Every time you get closer and closer to whatever it is until you finally merge and combine with whatever you desire and work on.</p>
 <br>
<h4>13/3/23</h4>
 
<p>I believe that people who are traumatized have disconnected their nervous system from certain parts of the body like the genitals for sexual trauma or parts of the mind for bad memories.</p>
 <br>
<h4>14/3/23</h4>
 
<p>This shows a very simple computer system architecture. At the bottom we have our kernel which is a software interface for the hardware parts like monitor, cpu, sound, graphics, the ability to write characters, access memory and hardware. Then I believe the middle is more stuff like i/o, windows, file systems, system calls to access deeper layers. And on top are our standard dll libraries that let you handle the lower level tasks and access lower level hardware, drivers, etc from a higher level. Examples are vulkan or directX for graphics.</p>
 <br>
<h4>15/3/23</h4>
 
<p>Stop thinking and giving your power away to others.</p>
 <br>
<h4>16/3/23</h4>
 
<p>You can write a program that does something and then create a GUI to access it. Websites are just glorified GUIs to backend servers which run programs or store data.</p>
 <br>
<p>The nerves are the lower physical form of the higher occultic energy system.</p>
<br>
<p>Nature tests a man and throws all kinds of wild struggles at him.</p> 
 <br>
<p>Perhaps the true highest point of masculinity is simply the ability to do. From that comes the ability to destroy and create, to rule, etc.
To be someone who can perform their ideas and intentions.</p>
 <br>
<h4>18/3/23</h4>
 
<p>There is a strong economical need to satisfy the problems of single people. More people than ever are single and childless. If you go to a single womans house, usually the garden is overgrown and there are small repair issues like broken door nobs that could be fixed. While a single man is likely to have a dirty, uncleaned house and to want someone to make his food. This isn't just lower level trades but also stuff like computer work or accounting work, depending on the class level of these people.</p>
 <br>
<p>Everything is done through will. To use the will is a form of magic, hence everything is done through magic.</p>
 <br>
<p>Voice, video, image, text, programs. These are some major computer communication protocols that you will want for any computer device. So a next gen one will have all of these similar to how a phone has them through apps. It also has stuff like calculators, web browsers, volume control, etc.</p>
 <br>
<h4>20/3/23</h4>
 
<p>Cookies are a pseudo rock. They are baked grain, sugar and other sweet things. Perhaps you could make rocks, crystals and other minerals by baking certain powders of minerals and crystals together with liquid binders.</p>
 <br>
<h4>22/3/23</h4>
 
<p>The current AI is being sold to companies for them to use, hence why it is so heavily restricted since a lot of companies sterilize and whitewash everything to avoid conflict.</p>
<br>
<h4>24/3/23</h4>
 
<p>Newton apparently had trouble with simple things. Perhaps his views on science were unrealistic and ungrounded due to this.</p>
 <br>
<p>One trait of autism is to hyper focus on one thing while perhaps a kind of opposite autism is to hyper not focus on outside things.</p>
 <br>
<p>Your fate or destiny is the root. It's what you'd do without any conscious change, the natural course where the wind takes you.</p>
 <br>
<h4>25/3/23</h4>
 
<p>Dark magic controls gravity, space, time.</p>
 <br>
<h4>26/3/23</h4>
 
<p>When learning a language, I notice that continuously reading the same word over and over again is a good way to learn it. Eventually you just remember and know what winter or summer is in another language.</p>
 <br>
<h4>28/3/23</h4>
 
<p>Sausage and bacon is like meat cheese.</p>
 <br>
<p>The water channels are used to drain down salts or nutrients into the soil.</p>
 <br>
<h4>29/3/23</h4>
 
<p>For language there is "social language" or words and phrases used during socializing with people. For example, “you”, or “they” or “I”, pronouns. 
Technical language is more how you describe things like what day it is, last week, how much money, what color or shape or position something is, etc.</p>
 <br>
<p>Peasant work is stuff like cooking, cleaning, crafting, building, etc. All basic life stuff for the necessity and upkeep of life.</p>
 <br>
<p>I think buying land and trying to build a house with basic materials is a feasible idea in today world.</p>
 <br>
<p>Laying on the left side and back of the body is positive, conscious and will heat and improve circulation in the body while the right and front side is negative, subconscious which will cool, moisten and help to store nutrients. The back and front is the most excessive of their element, meaning their effects in practical terms, while the sides are more neutral. Take note of this to balance your internal elements. Also sleeping on whichever side of your body is the weakest can help to strengthen that area.</p>
 <br>
<p>Red and blue flashing more than 24 frames a second can cause seizures.</p>
 <br>
<p>When you are the lowest caste of level 0. Your job is to clean. When you are level 1 of the farmer caste your job is to invest in the land. If you are the next level of 2, then perhaps create.</p>
 <br>
<h4>31/3/23</h4>
 
<p>Having a weak heart makes you sensitive, train the heart.</p>
 <br>
<p>The heart and head deal in spiritual matters while below deal in physical.</p>
 <br>
<p>-There was so much debate and media lies that there was no recession or economic depression that when the economy had finally started to become better, people didn't even notice they had been lied to and just saw the economy back to normal.</p>
 
<p>For around a year and a half the economy had been contracting and suffering. I noticed especially during the past half to 2/3rds of a year was the roughest period. If you look at stock and crypto markets or worked a gig job you noticed this. Most people noticed it with fuel and grocery prices, cost of living. All during this time the media talked about how we're not in a recession and how everything's fine.</p>
 
<p>Now the economy has started to go up and the media seems to be completely silent. In fact the traditional banking system is crumbling right now. So from this we can think that when the media talks about something, the opposite is currently happening, especially if it speaks about it happening in the future.</p>
