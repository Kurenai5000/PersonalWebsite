<h4>1/12/23</h4>
 
<p>The more work you do today is the less you need to do tomorrow.</p>
 <br>
<h4>2/12/23</h4>
 
<p>When going fast you can't turn on an axis, only tilt seemingly.</p>
 <br>
<p>Soon, companies may need to offer living spaces like in China so that people can work and live. I guess extreme poverty is the start of communes/communism?</p>
 <br>
<p>Perhaps stem cells are in the urine and that is circulating through the body during sleep or meditation.</p>
 <br>
<p>Usually in life, to get the things you want and do what you want to do, it is slow and steady, built up over years and years. To get a radically different life or have a wish granted without putting in the work requires a kind of gambling. Gambling does not always work, hence why changing your life and becoming rich in a day probably will never happen, and if it could, it's hinging on a gamble.</p>
 <br>
<p>One of the powers of the earth element is callousness, to resist all things be them emotion, pain, hunger, thirst, exhaustion, fatigue, etc. 
The negatives of this is numbness. Being excessively numb to one of your senses can cause issues in life.</p>
 <br>
<p>Older people have an excess in the earth element.</p>
 <br>
<p>If you focus at a certain center of the body it condenses a kind of essence in that specific organ. Digestive juices in the intestines, urine in the bladder, brain juices in the brain for example.  This seems to help aid the organ, heal it and its subordinary faculties like the nervous system which is lead by the brain. Perhaps extended focus and even condensation of this essence can strengthen it and then strengthen the organ. Else wise these various essences and substances can be volatilized or raised to a higher center or condensed further into lower ones.</p>
<br>
<h4>4/12/23</h4>
 
<p>Silicon liquid electrical insulation.</p>
 <br>
<p>-Heat/fire raises the state of physical, earthly matter from the physical elemental form into a liquid watery resin form then an airy gas or smoke and finally a plasma form, similar to how smoke or gas produces a flame if subject to fire. Hence, heat is the key to spiritualizing matter, or one of them. You can use high heat and pressure, essentially using a vessel to hold the forging reaction to merge two elements together. In a simple form this is amalgamating metals, in a more complex way it is creating meta-materials.</p>

<p>Cold lowers all things into their basest, most physical form. This is how volatile gasses are solidified into an ice like form. Various salts are also crystallized while in a liquid due to cold.</p>
 
<p>The air condenses into liquids which form salts that probably crystallize and further turn into glasses, earths, etc. Perhaps heat or plasma creates space for air to be?</p>
 <br>
<p>Accupoints can be used to treat and stimulate the organs and parts of the body.</p>
 <br>
<h4>5/12/23</h4>
 
<p>The bowels might be the furnace or heater. The bladder the cauldron.</p>
 <br>
<h4>6/12/23</h4>
 
<p>New organs may grow in the human body with more development.</p>
 <br>
<p>I wonder if the white paint that Japanese women wear is to emulate the white true northerners who might've came to Japan before.</p>
 <br>
<h4>7/12/23</h4>
 
<p>"Take DNA. Put in water. Stimulate with various radio frequencies. Remove DNA. Place antenna around the water. Send the signal emitted by the water to another lab with water infused with amino acids etc of DNA The acids recombine to form the original DNA from the signal."</p>
 <br>
<h4>11/12/23</h4>
 
<p>Income methods - Resource production, resource refinement, creations of goods, services, trading.</p>
 <br>
<h4>12/12/23</h4>
 
<p>You can tense the head to strengthen the mind. The inner head area, the brain. Doing this might help with psychic abilities.</p>
 
<p>-If you look at animals, especially the eyes you can see different levels of intelligence to them. Fish and birds seem very brain dead, almost like an automaton. Owls though have a higher level of consciousness, more noble and majestic compared to the common bird.</p>
 
<p>Horses can have a wise presence to them similar to the owl. Dogs depend on their owners and breed, cats have a certain level of intelligence. 
Rabbits are simple, a bit lower than a cat. Mouse a bit higher than rabbits. The size of the animal seems to correlate somewhat with intelligence vaguely.</p>
 
<p>Usually common animals range from low functioning automatons or even lower level like insects to middle functioning, capable of simple emotions to higher functioning which can access lots of emotions and even some faculties of understanding like a human child. People are a bit like this too.</p>
 <br>
<h4>15/12/23</h4>
 
<p>Heat causes stuff to grow like the suns light on a plant. Water seems to give form.</p>
 <br>
<h4>16/12/23</h4>
 
<p>In the past, people lived and experienced life. They figured out the qualities of different natural things through experimenting with them and that became common cultural knowledge, to know local items of local areas.</p>
<br>
<p>Energy leads matter. Or mind you can think, emotions as well lead matter, reality. Sometimes matter leads those though.</p>
 <br>
<h4>17/12/23</h4>
 
<p>Base parts of society - Producers(farmers, hunters, miners, loggers), crafters(carpentry, metal, brick), protectors, governers(rulers, councilmen), magicians(scientists, priests, maybe artists), peasants(breeders, families, misc), merchants, artists.</p>
 <br>
<p>Their hierarchy would be as follows from lowest to highest. Producers - peasants - crafters - protectors - merchants - artists - magicians â€“ governers.</p>
 <br>
<p>Water goes down and fire goes up.</p>
 <br>
<p>Lesbians are the foulest of creatures. Postnote - Ugliness is a choice. Basic physical maintenance goes a long way.</p>
 <br>
<h4>18/12/23</h4>
 
<p>There's two major forms of crystals, resinous ones that are glassy and more geometrical, salt like ones. As well as clear, glassy crystals and dull, earthy crystals.</p>
 <br>
<p>Major faculties of a human - movement, emotions, senses, speech, thought, reproductive, internal(digestive, excretory, respiratory, circulatory etc).</p>
 <br>
<h4>20/12/23</h4>
 
<p>The crown chakra is the reverse root. It roots you to the imaginary-spiritual world instead of the material-physical world.</p>
 <br>
<h4>21/12/23</h4>
 
<p>Tin seems to effect my throat.</p>
 <br>
<p>Ceramic, metal and glass, the three earthly materials.</p>
 <br>
<p>Peptide synthesis is forming protein from amino acids.</p>
 <br>
<p>The balls on Christmas trees might of been mercury globes.</p>
 <br>
<p>I'm noticing that a lot of attraction is based on phenotype. So a woman with the correct colors, features, sizes, shapes and such that you want is going to be attractive.</p>
 <br>
<h4>22/12/23</h4>
 
<p>Younger people are so strongly stuck in a scarcity mode that they are unable to have children. The DINKs(Dual income, no kids) are stuck in the pleasure-ego areas still not yet at the family zone. To have a family they need to satisfy their lower areas well in order to have a good foundation.
Some men trade living in a white first world country for a third world country where things are cheaper. This puts them above a couple levels and then they are able to have a family.</p>
 <br>
<p>Silver seems to stimulate the mind and sexual region, but I still don't know yet. The memory region/back of the head.</p>
 <br>
<p>With the Japanese person, I believe that the brain and nerves develops very quickly and that is their prominent part of the body. This gives them a mature facial look while having a skinny, malnourished body. The African is the opposite. They have a fully filled out body from a young age but an undeveloped mind/brain and nerves.</p>
 <br>
<p>Eventually we'll have robots do pre-programmed tasks like creating food from a certain menu. It will require its ingredients in special containers and to be in a specialized kitchen that allows it to understand everything. Similarly if it is building something it needs specialized materials but eventually it will be able to have more and more creativity and ability to go beyond pre-selected designs, tools, materials and such. Similar to a human learning.</p>
 <br>
<p>Physical attraction can be quantized as phenotype. So what color skin, hair, height, length of hair or style, facial structure, bodily structure, eye color, eye brow thickness and other qualities do you like? A person who has the matching qualities that you want should stimulate attraction within you.</p> 
 <br>
<p>Science is exceptionally simple and natural. It's just that any information or the way it's taught is very abstract and detached from what is physically happening. Chemistry and biology are kitchen arts while physics is a workshop art. They are practical before theoretical. I imagine most people don't even understand the physical substances or the forces of the words they speak. Understanding the reality of these things will show you how simple it is.</p>
 <br>
<p>How can we control every factor of a human? Their skin color probably changes due to diet and sun exposure. Hair color as well perhaps due to that. Maybe also due to the kind of minerals they are exposed too. Bodily shape is changed through diet and exercise. Height relates to intelligence and hormones.</p>
 <br>
<h4>23/12/23</h4>
 
<p>Electrolyzing lead is very grounding. So electrolysis is a way to produce radiation of the metal. Essentially a magical field of that feeling or type.
Doing active stuff dries you out. Exercise, etc. Then relaxing stuff makes you more moist. Too much of either and you get too dry/hot or too wet/cold.</p>
 <br>
<p>Iron feels pretty inflammatory. Stimulating, spicy, painful.</p>
 <br>
<p>Red is the color of Italy. Italy would be fire, Germany earth, England air and France water.</p>
 <br>
<p>If you want to make a country then buy land. Back in the day, countries were small regions of land that family clans owned. They then expanded out to the countries we know today.</p> 
 <br>
<h4>24/12/23</h4>
 
<p>While electrolyzing metal in water you can feel the metals energy. Lead for example is very grounding and stabilizing while iron is burning and painful. Electrifying a coil of metal also does this.</p> 
 <br>
<p>Mineral - Raw ore, metal, carbonate, oxide, hydroxide, sulfate, acetate.</p>  
 <br>
<p>If you run a business, don't take donations. Sell something instead. That way people get something for their money and are happy. Even digital products are better than nothing.</p> 
 <br>
<p>Seven days in a week, 52 weeks in a year, 365.5 days in a year. How many years in a greater cycle?</p> 
 <br>
<p>Medicine is a refined form of natural things.</p> 
 <br>
<p>To understand the difficult language of science, know that it's speaking of something that is, something that exists. Usually at least. Then your job is to figure out what it really is talking about, what the means relate to physically in reality.</p> 
 <br>
<h4>25/12/23</h4>

<p>Earth and fire is explosion, dust explosions.</p> 
 <br>
<h4>26/12/23</h4>
 
<p>Copper helps urinary-genital issues. Lead helps those of the bowels. You can wear them as jewellery.</p> 
 <br>
<h4>27/12/23</h4>
 
<p>Get your work done for the year so that you can have a good next year, prepare for it.</p> 
 <br>
<p>Experience is the greatest thing, greater than wealth because it can teach you how to make it, greater than strength or intelligence. With experience you have already internally conquered everything that you've experienced and life allows for a greater path.</p> 
 <br>
<h4>28/12/23</h4>
 
<p>Experience is the master quality. With it you could enter another body and still be able to do or at least train that body to do what you can currently do. You'll know everything you used to know, what is good and bad in life. If you have the experience of gaining wealth, you can do it again if poor.</p> 
 <br>
<p>Salt is another mineral product.</p> 
 <br>
<p>Maybe aggression comes from the belly if it is the martial center. Or even the heart could be as iron is in the blood.</p> 
 <br>
<p>Happiness comes from the crown. Positive energy.</p> 
 <br>
<p>In a corporate world everything becomes corporate, in a world of war everything becomes a weapon. AI had infinite potential and is now the front end for a websites shop in order to replace customer service. An ultimate tool of man reduced to a shop service assistant.</p> 
 <br>
<p>An AC motor technically makes power out of nothing. It's just a couple coils moving around magnets. The power is generated out of space or aether.</p> 
 <br>
<p>Supposedly bismuth is the heaviest stable element.</p> 
 <br>
<p>Radio is EMF.</p> 
 <br>
<h4>29/12/23</h4>

<p>Evil memories seem to come from a weakness in the back of the head. So perhaps memories come from the back of the head.</p> 
 <br>
<p>Control the back of the head to restrain phantom memories.</p> 
 <br>
<p>Silver relates to the subconscious, it soothes it. Subconscious is the back of the head, conscious is the front.</p> 
 <br>
<p>I think the metal shell of an appliance is meant to be connected to the grounding wire so that it can release the radiation back out.</p> 
 <br>
<h4>30/12/23</h4>
 
<p>Carbon dioxide is supposedly the byproduct of fermentation and the driving force of life.</p> 
 <br>
<p>In drawing, everything is just geometry, squares, triangles, circles.</p> 
 <br>
<p>One way to get rich is by being cheap/tight with your money.</p> 
 <br>
<h4>31/12/23</h4>
 
<p>My potato plants have flowered quickly in summer. So instead of putting their nutrients into the potatoes, they used it to flower. I assume in winter that plants feed their roots/tubers more instead of flowering. I wonder how this relates to people. Some are early bloomers and others are slow, later bloomers. So some people feed their earth or lower areas and grow slowly while others grow quick and seem to live in a world of summer as opposed to winter.</p> 
 <br>
<p>What do you need to live the life you want? What do you NOT have, but need?</p> 
 <br>
<p>It's difficult to control and manage something that isn't yours or your responsibility. The local city or town no longer being a collective responsibility of the village makes it so that no one is really able to legally keep peace and order in these places except for the elected officers or officials. To say, you don't clean or fix a house which isn't yours, and you don't feel an obligation to.</p>
