<h4>1/2/23</h4>

<p>Gears and rods are the basis of simple engineering.</p>
<br>
<p>When the mind goes into the physical or earth element then engineering and construction/building become great and advanced.</p>
 <br>
<p>Make a program that can reprogram its self.</p>
 <br>
<p>Certain songs produce a feeling of nirvana or the highest emotion or feeling in you. Pictures can also do this but it's easier to do it through music I find. I guess an orgasm is the physical manner of producing it. You could also do it physically through touch.</p>
 <br>
<h4>2/2/23</h4>
 
<p>OS basic programs - File system, time system, word processor, image program, audio program, video program, programming IDE(Could be done in word processor or extension of), system tools like system stat and program monitors, settings(Display, resolution, customization, region, date/time), software download pages, web browser. Video/picture/audio/text player.</p>
 
<p>OS parts - Terminal(Or is this the shell, an in between?), networking, sound driver, video driver, usb dongle support(Mouse, mic, keyboard, etc), boot loader, compiler.</p>
 <br>
<p>An Operating system is a program that sits on top of the hardware that lets sub programs run without having to go straight to the hardware, like running assembly code.</p>
 <br>
<h4>3/2/23</h4>
 
<p>The difference between ice and fire is acceleration.</p> 
 
<h4>4/2/23</h4>
 
<p>A universal language - It would be pictorial with the pronunciation, common to that country or region under the bottom. Similar to Chinese.
Automatons are very interesting. Wood could be used as a base material, metal and plastic too.</p>
 <br>
<p>Hinge joints, ball joints, cogs, rods.</p>
 <br>
<p>Occult observations on numbers. I believe that odd numbers are masculine while even are feminine or negative.</p>
 <br>
<p>In martial arts you can practice moves while standing, walking and running. Practice them in all ways to become a better fighter.</p>
 <br>
<p>There's a recipe of creating a homunculus from putting sperm in a putrefying pumpkin and covering it in manure. So the pumpkin acts as a womb and the manure acts as a heat source. You could substitute both of these for other means.</p>
 <br>
<p>When an animal gains self consciousness they can start to meditate, circulate their internal energy and train to become immortal.</p>
 <br>
<p>Health can be gained through opening up blockages in the accupoints of the body, allowing the natural flow of blood and energy.</p>
 <br>
<p>Yang energy gives masculinity, the energy to do.</p>
 <br>
<p>I'm sinking the spiritual energy into my root or physical body which I guess enhances and builds it. So from matter we can burn it into energy and from energy we can recondense it back into matter of our type/choosing.</p>
 <br>
<h4>5/2/23</h4>
 
<p>Programming in socialization, human structures, family, society, culture, social rules, etc could make a robot sound more human.</p>
 <br>
<p>The ability to use the body, social skills, language, thought(Imagination, verbal thought, auditory), consciousness, sexuality, emotions and desires, these are some base qualities of a human.</p>
 <br>
<h4>6/2/23</h4>
 
<p>Perhaps it wasn't the music that I admired or the playing of the instrument but the energy/emotion produced and put into the work and experience.</p>
 <br>
<p>Supposedly a big ring finger indicates a big penis, so that would be a strong water element.</p>
 <br>
<p>As you train spiritually, you'll gain innate abilities which are natural to you and your energies type.</p>
 <br>
<p>Learn to analyze the whole face and then separate parts of it to understand the person.</p>
 <br>

 <br>
<h4>10/2/23</h4>
 
<p>Tabletop and board games are just computer games before computers. So maybe making a card, board or tabletop game and then putting it to pc would be a good idea.</p>
<br>
<p>The same way that making a lot of noise invokes your next door neighbors, doing certain things invokes certain spirits or feelings around you. Having art or different types of decorations is one way.</p>
 <br>
<h4>12/2/23</h4>
 
<p>Facial diagnostic - Very pale white = lung. Very dark black = kidney. Green = liver, red = heart, yellow = stomach.</p>
 <br>
<p>Doing something without compensation. Love can do that to a person, or being too good natured. Naivete and foolishness are a result if over exercised.</p>
 <br>
<h4>13/2/23</h4>
 
<p>Painting with big shapes instead of small likes is more of a way to paint.</p>
 <br>
<p>If you don't sacrifice for your goals then your goals become the sacrifice.</p>
 <br>
<p>You'll regret the things you didn't do more than the things you did do.</p>
 <br>
<p>Space and matter are the two dualities. Movement perhaps is spatially related.</p>
 <br>
<p>Tensing in the body is a muscular activity.</p>
 <br>
<h4>14/2/23</h4>
 
<p>Sweet things when fermented can start to smell sexual.</p>
 <br>
<p>During cold, night time and negative times/effects, your energy starts to condense inwardly into the body, or forms into matter.</p>
<br>
<p>For 2d game menus, everything is a box which can be selected with keys or a mouse. A 2D flat area to select a function. For 3D you have a world to select in.</p>
 <br>
<p>We need to use more EMF shielding in technology.</p>
 <br>
<h4>16/2/23</h4>
 
<p>Hyper sexuality can be from sexual trauma.</p>
 <br>
<h4>17/2/23</h4>
 
<p>Human animal hybrids - http://www.macroevolution.net/caprinid-human-hybrids-today.html</p>
 <br>
<p>Ghidra, NSA reverse engineering software.</p>
 <br>
<h4>18/2/23</h4>
 
<p>To fight against women, you fight with emotions instead of fists or violence.</p>
 <br>
<p>Warehouses and factories, the negative and positive of manufacturing.</p>
 <br>
<p>There is an inherent mathematic flow or nature to reality that divination can tap into in order to predict a probable future. Diviners are good at naturally feeling and understanding this or using tools to uncover it.</p>
 <br>
<h4>19/2/23</h4>
 
<p>Hyperborea is the north pole, Tartaria is Russia.</p>
 <br>
<h4>20/2/23</h4>
 
<p>Leftist lack an individual self, a soul. They instead exist as a group mind/entity.</p>
 <br>
<p>Making money off anything is to run a business that engages in that field. So instead of being an artist, you are a businessman who deals in art.</p>
 <br>
<p>Perhaps men create the world and women are effected by the world.</p>
 <br>
<p>Supposedly high estrogen stops women from growing taller. But hypogonadalism can cause men to become tall, lanky.</p>
 <br>
<h4>21/2/23</h4>
 
<p>Seems that root disorders are getting worse in children. The young nowadays have lower iq, weak bodies, many mental and personality disorders. They need to heal themselves on an occultic and physical level. Seems that they have a severe mercury or throat/speech disorder too. This is related to autism.</p>
 <br>
<p>Teach kids to journal in order to learn how to write.</p>
 <br>
<p>At a root, lower level, the world is just a competition, of strength and food. Humans at this level present this kind of behavior. Once the animals are more fed, they can start to socialize and live together without eating or killing one another.  Though, when succumbing to their lower nature, they can still fight and kill one another.</p>
 <br>
<p>AI makes the net more like the astral plane where you can imagine things into being and where spirits exist.</p>
 <br>
<p>First teach people physically then digitally. Learn to write physically then on a computer.</p>
 <br>
<p>Market research on social media. See what is trending what can sell well.</p>
 <br>
<p>Some people are good at delivering, acting, talking, etc but lack substance and value. Others have value, substance, a good message but suck at speaking and presenting.</p>
 <br>
<p>Milk = fat and protein rich substance that you can make a oil rich butter from or protein curd.</p>
 <br>
<p>Maybe vegetative waste and animal corpses turn into dirt.</p> 
 <br>
<p>http://www.thelemapedia.org/index.php/Tree_of_Life:The_Human_Body</p>
 <br>
<p>In the modern world a lot of tech is moving to on webpage instead of apps. I'd rather programs that I own personally.  Phone apps are a secondary to the websites.</p>
 <br>
<p>A vlog is more done by external people because they show off their life and environment while an internal person is more interested in their inner world.</p>
 <br>
<p>You can poke nerves to cause effects in the body. This is probably what old martial artists did.</p>
 <br>
<p>The lower body is the collection vessel. The middle torso is the transmutation area and the upper torso is the spiritual zone.</p>
 <br>
<p>Breathing gathers spiritual energy or substances. I think it is transmuted by the kidneys into lower or higher energies perhaps.</p>
 <br>
<h4>23/2/23</h4>
 
<p>The red of the crown or root and yellow of the solar plexus are the forces of a king or ruler.</p>
 <br>
<p>We can recreate people with AI like in that one steins gate season using their old videos. It wouldn't be a perfect replication but at least what they've shown and implied.</p>
 <br>
<h4>24/2/23</h4>
 
<p>Perhaps those of an evil or extremely lower nature live their next life as an animal.</p>
 <br>
<h4>25/2/23</h4>
 
<p>Focus on the top of the head to gain willpower.</p>
 <br>
<p>Routine is the foundation of your life. It supports everything else.</p>
 <br>
<p>To add more detail in art you add more lines or color shades.</p>
 <br>
<p>You widen when resting and lengthen when stimulated. So men usually lengthen and women widen.</p>
 <br>
<h4>26/2/23</h4>
 
<p>A bad trait of mercurial people is to lie.</p> 
<br>
<p>-The generational cycle. One person invests low into their root in order to build wealth, restore, build, gather, etc. Then the next generations enjoy the luxury that this has built.  Usually the desire to store and invest comes from poverty and hardship.</p>

<p>The later generation I imagine pisses away all of their wealth and earth energy on drugs, fun, etc. Then it creates hard times for the next which recycles it.</p>

<p>It happens over 80 years so that would be 4-5 generations in the old ages since children were usually born before 20. It then went to three and probably in todays time it might reach 2-3 generations of time.</p>
 <br>
<h4>27/2/23</h4>
 
<p>Plants are like animals but less animated. I can feel their feelings. I imagine that when eating them we are eating their life force.  I think minerals are also alive in a way and die when plucked from the earth. We can also eat their life force.</p>
 <br>
<p>Animals are the most rich in raw life force from their animated nature.</p>
 <br>
<p>Talisman creation. Pouch full of auspicious herbs, minerals, animals parts, oils, blessed and with magical words written on it.</p>
 <br>
<p>Engaging in socializing improves your social skills and gains you social power.</p>
 <br>
<p>People are like a resource that you collect, gather, refine, etc when socializing and then can call upon them again.</p>
 <br>
<h4>28/2/23</h4>
 
<p>The Yacuub legend is about Jews.</p>
 <br>
<p>It's fascinating to see the contrast between people who were cool in school and now in the real world how some things changes. Not everything shifts but some things do.</p>
 <br>
<p>Muscle is like wood in how it has grains.</p>
 <br>
<p>Programs just like anything else is also divided into archetypes.</p>
