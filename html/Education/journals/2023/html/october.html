<h4>1/10/23</h4>
 
<p>Too many toxins in the body can stop it from developing or cause it to have issues. This in the brain causes mental retardation in different faculties like memory, critical thinking, senses, etc. In the throat, which is like a filter from the body to the head, if too many toxins store here it seems to cause vocal issues and kinds of autism.</p>
 <br>
<h4>2/10/23</h4>
 
<p>The lower body seems to be related to storing matter or substances and the upper body expends or uses them. Maybe the belly/upper belly is the center point.</p>
 <br>
<p>Gen z and probably gen alpha is a show of what happens when we've hit the lowest point of genetics. </p>
 <br>

 <br>
<p>Plants in pots wither and die due to dehydration if they don't have an external water source. Plants in the ground get water from underground.</p>

<p>Keep more lead around you, it's great for stress relief.</p>
 <br>
<h4>18/10/23</h4>
 
<p>“A belief in ancient times was that rice plants would mate with or otherwise be fertilized by lightning, a frequent occurrence in the late summer and autumn when rice plants come to fruition.”</p>
 <br>
<p>Everything does something, everything you eat, drink, the colors in your room or clothes, the chemicals made to make those colors, the lighting, etc.
Your thoughts, people around you, country, etc.  We simply get used to everything to such a point that it becomes subconscious or not thought of.</p>
 <br>
<p>Paprika is red dried bell peppers.</p>
 <br>
<h4>19/10/23</h4>

<p>Mixing different metals, herbs and earthly products is one way the Chinese alchemists made their elixirs.</p>
 <br>
<p>Vinegar and salt peter were used to remove poison from elixirs.</p>
 <br>
<p>Salting and brining meats stops it from decaying.</p>
 <br>
<p>An elixir of immortality is a drug made from natural things like plants, animals and mostly minerals that grant an immortal body and spirit to the person who consumes them.</p>

<h4>22/10/23</h4>
 
<p>Angels may be white folk from the hidden north. Fallen angels are white people who mix into other races.</p>
 <br>
<p>Heaven may be the greater northern continents. Mount meru or the north pole, Atlantis. The southern continents are hell.</p>
 <br>
<p>Broth is food essence.</p>
<br>
<h4>25/10/23</h4>
 
<p>Food salts are probably made by simmering meats, fat, organs, bones and other stuff in water and adding salt to it, drying it out after sifting out the impurities.</p>
 <br>
<h4>26/10/23</h4>
 
<p>A sage exists within their mind and avoids people who bring them into their heart and lower. They don't exist within the world of man, of society but in a higher world in the mountains or in the modern world, their lab, rooms, workshops and other places.</p>
 <br>
<h4>29/10/23</h4>
 
<p>Mica gives electrons.</p>
 <br>
<p>You can extract the flavors of natural things by simmering them in water. This extracts their essence. The flavor is within the essence. So you can think that the smell of something is a property of its air and the flavor is a property of its water. The touch/feeling is a property of its physical body.</p>
 <br>
<p>Physics is the master ruler of our world and the master ruler of physics could be called occultism or metaphysics. The science of archetypes and numbers are part of this occultism.</p>
 <br>
<p>All of your senses can combine to form one which is a combination of all of the senses. This is how you can see through fences or walls by hearing and feeling exactly where someone or something is.</p>
 <br>
<p>Extracted food essence is a flavor enhancement, it is like a chefs drug.</p>
 <br>
<h4>30/10/23</h4>
 
<p>During the first week or so of the sun entering a certain astrological sign the associated organs seem to purge themselves of their toxins. After this, the fuller expression of that sign begins.</p>
 <br>
<h4>31/10/23</h4>
 
<p>Math is the father, physics is the mother or feminine principle.</p>
