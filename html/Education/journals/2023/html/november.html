<h4>1/11/23</h4>
 
<p>Esoteric physics and math teaches all things.</p>
 <br>
<h4>2/10/23</h4>
 
<p>Physics is the master of the world, maths is the master of physics, occultic science is the master of them both.</p>
  <br>
<p>If you raise mercury up high into the sky you probably get free energy.</p>
  <br>
<h4>3/11/23</h4>
 
<p>Programming is the basic and first skill of computers.</p>
  <br>
<p>-Plastic is like resin, It melts and turns gooey when heated. When cooled it hardens into a solid shape. Very interesting material as water or liquids it can take any form. Plastic can become like a water then solidify into a solid, hardening into a physical object of any shape.</p>

<p>Metal acts like a resin similar to plastic and glasses when heated. So there are certain materials which can be heated and reforged or formed into new shapes and other materials like wood which can't, they burn. Fabric, furs, wools, etc.</p>
  <br>
<h4>4/11/23</h4>

<p>Rose quartz is very nice and relaxing.</p>
  <br>
<h4>5/11/23</h4>
 
<p>More electro medical stuff - ozone, ultra violet.</p>
  <br>
<h4>6/11/23</h4>
 
<p>I had a psychic thought while half asleep that the eye color relates to ones inherent consciousness. So blue eyes are within the head, green in the heart area, light brown colors in the belly and brown in the base of the body. Then the darker and lighter shades represent lower and higher points within these parts of the body so a lighter blue is higher in the head.</p>
  <br>
<p>Japanese women probably have larger boobs compared to other Asians because of all of the iodine. Also the eating of pork in certain cultures probably enlarges them.</p>
  <br>
<h4>7/11/23</h4>
 
<p>Carbon is the body of most things alongside the minerals/ashes.</p>
  <br>
<p>When you burn stuff down you find that the physical structure of most organic things is carbon, a black powder. There's also a lot of oils or resinous compounds too. Finally the grey/white minerals are all that's left if you remove the carbon from it.</p>
  <br>
<p>Smithing and metal refining will teach you earthliness as well as making of bricks and structures out of earth.</p>
  <br>
<p>The earth element is that of wealth.</p>
  <br>
<p>The basis of society is the relationship between men and women. The family is the source of society.</p>
  <br>
<h4>8/11/23</h4>
 
<p>When you speak you create a wave or ripple. That can ripple back to you in the form of others saying something, thinking something or acting. It's why you choose what you say or do carefully as to create the right wave, one which wont backfire. This can cause a fear of speaking in one though so you do need to be mindful of that.</p>
  <br>
<h4>9/11/23</h4>
 
<p>Think of the world in terms of solids, liquids and airs or space.</p>
  <br>
<p>The weather is a function of the spiritual, spacial or airy layer of reality. It can effect the physical and water levels.</p>
  <br>
<h4>10/11/23</h4>
 
<p>First in the heavens is the white center of light or pure energy. This filters into the ring of the logos, the zodiacal or archetypal ring like how light filters into prime colors. From these prime colors we gain imagination or a mental realm of forms that you can sense, experience with your mind.</p>
  <br>
<h4>11/11/23</h4>
 
<p>The issue with countries like Australia and America and which has leaked out into other western first world nations is that they are somewhat rootless. Coming to a new country to colonize and build infrastructure then immigrants coming in means that they are without stable ground to them. 
Back home in a country where your ancestors have lived for many generations is a place with roots, with connections, with knowledge of that area but in the new countries there is no knowledge of them or connections or anything else.</p>
  <br>
<h4>12/11/23</h4>
 
<p>Robots, AI and other forms of automation will eventually take over any job that it can. There are no limits with the abilities of machines. I wonder if once the robots take all of our work that they will build their own robots to take their jobs, then those robots live in luxury or leisure?</p>
  <br>
<h4>13/11/23</h4>
 
<p>Mercury in glass with a certain gas submerged in water supposedly purified it.</p>
  <br>
<p>I imagine that the giants were northerners and they came down south to find gold, silver, copper and other mines for their technology.</p>
  <br>
<p>Learn to make structures out of cement or cement blocks with sand and cement.</p>
  <br>
<p>Mental energy, being void like I assume has the potential to become anything, any element or any force like tension, pressure, movement, etc.</p>
  <br>
<h4>15/11/23</h4>
 
<p>To be elegant you focus on the crown. That kind of behavior focuses people up there.</p>
  <br>
<h4>16/11/23</h4>
 
<p>Use resin to affix stuff like putting gems into bone, metal or wood.</p>
  <br>
<h4>17/11/23</h4>
 
<p>Supposedly manipulating electrostatics lets you control "gravity" effecting objects. High frequency too.</p>
  <br>
<h4>18/11/23</h4>
 
<p>Engineering is the act of using science which is the understanding of reality or physics and math which is the understanding of proportion and the symbolization of these physics in order to create new "things".</p>
  <br>
<p>I think the sky is ever expanding and the earth is ever contracting. Tension and relaxation.</p>
 <br>
<h4>19/11/23</h4>
 
<p>-A motor provides strength or power, this can replicate that of an animal or human pushing something, turning a wheel or striking. Eventually we learned to make mechanical minds, the computer which can replicate and process sound, words and visuals. The emotions will be another part that can be create technologically, I imagine through modulated coils that can send and receive feelings through the air.</p>
 
<p>Assumably you could directly link something to an organ like the heart in order to track it. You could also use a device to sense the nonphysical force or field it puts out in order to read it. There are also analogical ways like through using the face, movement of the persons body, etc that in a roundabout way let you understand an inner part like an organ.</p>
  <br>
<h4>20/11/23</h4>
 
<p>The sound a voice makes seems to trigger emotions. Perhaps using ultrasonic or really deep frequencies could work too.</p>
  <br>
<p>First from the earth there is the air. Further on in the sky is the fire layer which is the blue area beyond the clouds.</p>
  <br>
<p>Combustion motors produce physical vibration while electric produce EMF.</p>
  <br>
<h4>21/11/23</h4>
 
<p>In a city there are higher and lower businesses. Lower businesses are simple crafts and markets. Usually the selling of simple goods, resources and services. Medium businesses are the selling of more complicated services like law and legal help, accounting and other specialty services.
Educational areas, government and religious institutions could be thought of as a higher level service.</p>
  <br>
<p>The white mans curse is complexity. Perhaps the black mans is simplicity.</p>
  <br>
<h4>25/11/23</h4>
 
<p>If you put a different mind in a body it would be able to do things that the old mind could not. Imagine if you possessed the body of another person, the body would limit you some until it gets used to your will and movement but you would be able to will it to do what you've trained yourself to do in the past or in another form eventually.</p>
  <br>
<p>Potentially the calories in metal produce heat in the body which is spiritual energy that you can circulate to heal yourself or feed/sink into your body to become stronger.</p>
  <br>
<p>Carbon acts as a dry lubricant, mix with alcohol supposedly.</p>
  <br>
<h4>26/11/23</h4>
 
<p>Emergency bike repair kit - Hex keys, adjustable wrench, puncture repair kit, pump, chain, chain tool, charger, spark plug.</p>
  <br>
<h4>27/11/23</h4>
 
<p>Your results show you where you stand, not where you want to be or think you are but where you're at.</p>
  <br>
<h4>28/11/23</h4>
 
<p>The government pressures companies. The companies pressure workers who pressure society. Society/parents/families pressures their children. The **** pressure the government.</p>
  <br>
<p>Physical training is mostly summarized as training the bodies ability to move, tense and relax.</p>
  <br>
<h4>29/11/23</h4>
 
<p>Supposedly certain shapes self propel or spin. Victor Shauberger talks about implosion.</p>
  <br>
<p>If you don't piss you wont need to drink as much. The body seems to circulate its own waters. It first stores waters as needed, then circulates them.</p>
  <br>
<h4>30/11/23</h4>

<p>Eating more salt probably regenerates urine.</p>
