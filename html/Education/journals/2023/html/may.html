<h4>1/5/23</h4>
 
<p>There's definitely a link between qi and electricity. It probably is electromagnetism. At least I feel more energy within me when I touch electrical things. The heart also links to this.</p>
<br>
<p>Learning to craft is good. Making stuff out of stuff.</p>
 <br>
<h4>2/5/23</h4>
 
<p>Diodes are like a one way road.</p>
 <br>
<p>When writing a book, course or educational material, or doing speeches. Think of it as if you want to give others information that they can download into themselves.</p>
 <br>
<h4>3/5/23</h4>

<h4>4/5/23</h4>
 
<p>To seek materialism for the sake of good can be done to gain land, food, skills, items and utilities for yourself and family to live a proper life.</p>
 <br>
<h4>6/5/23</h4>
 
<p>The man is judged by what he brings to the table and can accomplish in the future while the woman is judged by her past actions and life in a relationship.</p>
 <br>
<p>The world is made up of repeating prime archetypal patterns the same way that language is made up of characters/letters.</p>
 <br>
<p>There are fields of space and tension or an absence of the field and tension. Is relaxation just the absence of tension?</p>
 <br>
<p>Supposedly 90% of people are not psychologically developed beyond 12 years old. Explains everything.</p>
 <br>
<h4>7/5/23</h4>
 
<p>Plastic and metal are similar in how they're both gum or hardened resin like substances.</p>
 <br>
<p>The organization of the alchemical elements are ordered physical to nonphysical levels. This is similar to electromagnetic frequency in how that is organized. This being earth - any solids. Water - any liquids. Air - any gasses. Fire - attributed to flames and sometimes light. Aether - the space behind everything and sometimes linked to electromagnetism.</p>
 <br>
<p>Water can pickup on subtle non local fields. So forces in space assumably can effect water.</p>
 <br>
<h4>9/5/23</h4>
 
<p>Indians have pet rabbits. It relates to their lunar nature.</p>
 <br>
<h4>10/5/23</h4>
 
<p>Control the whole body as one</p>
 <br>
<p>Magic is the materialization of ones imagination. Work on that specifically. Trying to make imagined things or forces physical.</p>
 <br>
<p>Iron directs the magnetic fields.</p>
 <br>
<p>Occultic understanding - When you begin to understand archetypes to such a deep degree and learn to observe life, people, etc, you begin to understand everything and how to achieve anything you want. The more you observe life and see how things are done, you learn to do them. When you observe people and their actions you learn to work with them and direct them.</p>
 <br>
<h4>11/5/23</h4>
 
<p>High voltage = plasma/zap. High amperage = hot/red wire.</p>
 <br>
<p>Piss is a kidney extraction or extract so probably piss is jing and the bladder is the lower dan tien.</p>
 <br>
<p>You can focus on objects to tap into their energy. Sages did this with mercury. The lead I have in my room grounds me.</p>
 <br>
<p>High voltage, low current is cold electricity. High amp, low voltage is hot energy.</p>
 <br>
<h4>12/5/23</h4>
 
<p>We have a responsibility to the young to be good proper examples since they are very naive and manipulatable to bad forces.</p>
 <br>
<p>Plants have fat soluble and water soluble ingredients.</p>
 <br>
<h4>13/5/23</h4>
 
<p>I think AC is not going back and forth but a sine wave, hence phases in motors are coils that probably oscillate electromagnetic fields.</p>
 <br>
<h4>14/5/23</h4>
 
<p>I think lead is actually good. It has been demonized because the world is becoming rootless.</p>
 <br>
<p>Simplify English to be read as it is spoken. This is important for the future. French also needs that too.</p>
 <br>
<h4>17/5/23</h4>
 
<p>We have two phases, the active and passive. The active is hell and passive is heaven. Technically the opposite but we'll work with this.
So we do things in the active phase and take on trauma, pain, damage, etc. Then in the passive phase we rest, eat, relax, become bored and then eventually switch to the other.</p>
 <br>
<p>I'm starting to find that even guys in their 30's don't fully have their shit together. I guess it goes to show that if you get serious about life and take responsibility for yourself and what's around you at any age then you can get ahead, make a difference and improve yourself and life.</p>
 <br>
<p>There's a special look in the eyes of people that shows mental illness. Trust your judgement on people before you trust your programming.</p>
 <br>
<p>With computer chips I see a lot of pathways, metal connector areas, connecting to some kind of micro electronic piece. Everything in a circuit is voltage modulation and for computers it's turning a voltage on or off. The pathways lead the data or voltage and components do things with it.</p>
 <br>
<p>You are your own judge. You know if you did something bad or not.</p> 
 <br>
<p>Mechanical and electrical engineering, making bodies and giving them life with functional components.</p>
 <br>
<h4>18/5/23</h4>
 
<p>Tesla car batteries are around 350-500v and 100-250 ah. So around 50-100kw.</p>
 <br>
<h4>19/5/23</h4>
 
<p>The service economy is shit.</p>
 <br>
<p>By focusing on the eyes you can see spiritual energy which is like a mist or glow. My amulet has a huge aura to it.</p>
 <br>
<h4>20/5/23</h4>
 
<p>"Spirituality is of spirit or referring to spirit. Spirit is subtle energy. Today we just call it energy.</p> 
 <br>
<p>Things of a spiritual nature are non physical like mist, steam, air, fire, electromagnetism.</p>
 <br>
<p>If you focus your sense of feeling to a point within the body you can control spiritual energy.</p>
 <br>
<p>If you focus it within the center of the head you will gain temporary spiritual enlightenment or "enlivening the inner spirit" which is your soul, an energetic center in the mid brain.</p>
 <br>
<p>You can focus on the eyes to see this energy in the air around you. Trees usually have a white glow to them for example which is their energy field. The sky has tons of this energy which is scientifically high voltage."</p>
 <br>
<p>The ocean is a battery and the sun charges it. Maybe the land acts like metal/minerals in a battery.</p>
 <br>
<h4>21/5/23</h4>
 
<p>The yang or positive force and organs makes heat and pressure. Yin/negative, generates fluids and matter.</p>
 <br>
<h4>22/5/23</h4>
 
<p>There is the body and veins which channel blood. Circulation meditation channels the blood.</p>
 <br>
<h4>24/5/23</h4>
 
<p>An issue with modern society is that the people of the town, village or area do not have responsibility over it. Instead a government council has power over society. Hence the people become more childish and irresponsible for their outer living space. An example is, if something breaks, who fixes it? If someone is acting rowdy and dangerous, will you get charged for disciplining them?</p>
 <br>
<h4>26/5/23</h4>
 
<p>When working with electromagnetic coils you are working with the 5th element. You can feel it but not see it unless it is in a strong enough quantity and quality.</p>
 <br>
<p>Using a microwave for matter, metal, melting might be interesting. Maybe try that glass to gold experiment.</p>
 <br>
<p>The stars are angels and the planets are fallen stars supposedly.</p>
 <br>
<p>There is a cycle of wonder, mental exploration, learning and then doing, testing, experimenting physically. Usually you fail and have to retry it again and again, going through the cycle until you truly learn.</p>
 <br>
<h4>27/5/27</h4>
 
<p>Don't be prideful that you're stronger than the weak but be shameful that you're weaker then the strong.</p>
 <br>
<p>Life has rules. The laws of physics are like the base rules. If you learn them then you can control reality to a greater extent. Though, don't get caught up in the rules because you can also find yourself breaking them since life is only logical when it wants to be.</p>
 <br>
<h4>28/05/23</h4>
 
<p>There are resource gathering jobs like miner, logger, fisher, hunter, etc. Then there are crafting jobs that use those resources like chef, blacksmith, tanner, carpenter. After that are social jobs. Then management or ruler jobs.</p>
 <br>
<h4>30/5/23</h4>
 
<p>High energy lasers, large magnets to shoot laser through a portal can open time apparently. So focusing energy in a center or something I imagine. Argon gas and other gasses maintain the portal.</p>
 <br>
<p>Another method, using high voltage to melt space its self.</p>
 <br>
<p>Ring made of meta material, electrify it and you'll generate a portal.</p>
 <br>
<h4>31/5/23</h4>
 
<p>Men are defined by their careers, women by their families.</p>
 <br>
<p>Business. Manufacture a product or service and then learn to sell it/get a market.</p>
 <br>
<p>Sugar might be positive and salt negative, archetypally.</p>
