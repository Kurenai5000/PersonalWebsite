 <h4>1/2/24</h4>
 
 <p>-The brain and nerves are your sensors, they let you feel, see, smell, taste, and hear reality.
You also process this information in the brain. So the brain is the master controller of reality.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>3/2/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Star energy is radiation.
Assumably when minerals or gems absorb enough radiation, perhaps they start to become radioactive, similar to magnetic stuff. Maybe radiation and magnetism are essentially two sides of the same coin.
One makes you colder, the other hotter.
So then assumably you can make elements more magnetic or grounding as well? That would require alchemy to transmute metals.
If you could gather electrostatic from radiation, that would be important.(Postnote – Electrets.)</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Understanding electromagnetism is the next level to common physics or alchemy, knowledge of nature and natural things.
It's like the next tier.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Assumably some objects can store sunlight as radiation. Technically anything that gets hot is, to a lesser extent.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Certain materials probably resonate at the same frequency as the stars, hence absorbing or connecting to them.</p>
<br>
 <p>-By ww2, chemistry was mastered, by the 50-60s, emf was mastered.(Postnote - Realistically earlier.)</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Blood is heart essence and urine is kidney essence.(Postnote – I think Paracelsus called urine the sap of blood.)</p>
 <br>
 <h4>4/2/24</h4>
 
 <p>-The stars give off high frequency radiation like xray, ultra violet, gamma.
Radiation is the energy of the stars.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Supposedly amethyst is the gemstone of February.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-The apple vision pro thingo is probably the new smartphone. It might take over I imagine the same way the smartphone did. To say that VR is ready for mass adoption by normal folk.
Then the next step will be brain computer interfaces where you internally see, feel, smell, taste and touch everything probably from a headset or neckset stimulating your brain or spinal nerve. 
I wonder if it will be done through low frequency inaudible acoustic waves or radio waves. You need something that can penetrate bone to hit the brain so probably it could be even higher frequency but low power as to not cook your brain and nerves. 
This is non invasive at least. Invasive will just use metal cords to cause electrical stimulation as an input/output, but that's nasty.
I guess that also makes me wonder how will the output work? The brain can emit low power emf, we'd have to tap into that.
Otherwise it's just creating a database in order to interpret brain signals/gestures into computer gestures like up/down/left/right movement, mouse clicks and other geometrical or pressure modulation actions. Of course, where the signals go to the brain also needs to be worked out in order to cause audible hallucinations and visuals, etc. I think the military did work on that on how to make people hear voices and see stuff so I might need to check out those papers to get a better idea.(Postnote – Still, VR is too expensive for mass adoption. I think that’s the main issue. Technologically it’s ready.)</p>
 <br>
 <h4>5/2/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Volts = speed, amps = amount.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Maybe black soil has a bunch of charcoal in it.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>7/2/24</h4>
 
 <p>-To divide the sky, understand time and the stars, this is astrology.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-If you know what you're doing or what to do and have the tools, you can work quickly and get a lot of work done. Spending an entire day on something can get a week or two of work done, even more if you are experienced.
Correct tools, stamina and experience all help you to do the work of 10 men.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>8/2/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Demonic cultivation I assume is training of the lower areas like the earth and water elements, the genitals, bowels, bladder, etc.
Their intention is not ascension.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>9/2/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Cameras use software and AI to edit reality or visuals so you're not seeing what you're truly taking a picture of.
With the rise of AR/VR, what we see and hear may be filtered, at least headsets made by large corporations in order to control what their customers experience. 
Eventually with full dive VR, the entire experience of life may be altered from birth and then some controlled humans may never experience true reality.</p> 
 <br>
 <p>-"Tis true without lying, certain & most true.
That which is below is like that which is above & that which is above is like that which is below to do the miracles of one only thing.
And as all things have been & arose from one by the mediation of one: so all things have their birth from this one thing by adaptation.
The Sun is its father, the moon its mother, the wind hath carried it in its belly, the earth is its nurse.
The father of all perfection in the whole world is here.
Its force or power is entire if it is converted into earth.
Separate thou the earth from the fire, the subtle from the gross sweetly with great industry.
It ascends from the earth to the heaven & again it descends to the earth & receives the force of things superior & inferior.
By this means, you shall have the glory of the whole world & thereby all obscurity shall fly from you.
Its force is above all force. For it vanquishes every subtle thing & penetrates every solid thing.
So was the world created.
From this are & do come admirable adaptations whereof the means (or process) is here in this. Hence I am called Hermes Trismegist, having the three parts of the philosophy of the whole world
That which I have said of the operation of the Sun is accomplished & ended." - Might be Newtons translation of the Emerald tablets, I forget.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>10/2/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Electrochemistry is its own field. Perhaps more work can teach you more about how to make chemicals with it.(Postnote – Splitting different liquids than water would be interested like how water is separated into oxygen and hydrogen via electrolysis.)</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Grease your threads and bolts. I've found that it stops rust, lets you remove nuts or other hardware easily and put it in easily as well as stops vibration from loosening your stuff. 
Lard works, any thick fat will do.(Postnote – Avoid this for aluminium threads or be very careful not to over torque those. Works fine for thick bolts or wood and metal work though.)</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Learn to go beyond your abilities. When you want to stop for the day and do it tomorrow, keep going and continue. It's too slow to wait for another day.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>11/2/24</h4>
 
 <p>-I imagine if a parent has given up on any intellectual pursuits like studying, reading, writing, thinking, etc that their child will struggle intellectually with language and studies in their youth. 
Parents in the past just assumed their kids could function properly when born.</p>
 
<p>In this era we see many kids with physical, speech, social, intellectual or other issues as a common thing. I wonder how much of physical, mental and other developmental difficulties is just a result of weak, stupid, untrained parents and then a lack of training or poor teaching for the child.</p> 
 
<p>To say that an attitude of "it'll just work or be fine" does not work and your child is a direct result of you and all of your own shortcomings or weakpoints.</p>
<br>
 
 <p>-When you run a business you have to buy and repair your own tools. If they're not working then you can't work so backups and spare parts are smart to have.
Really, you become a part time mechanic at whatever thing you use alongside whatever tasks you're already doing if you're your own boss.</p>
<br> 

 <p>-Just know that the first couple of years are the roughest.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Maybe the mid life crisis is when someone reaches the mid point of their life, goes beyond just trying to survive and get by. Then they seek meaning in their life.</p>
 <br>
<p>-Drugs get us beyond this horizon line or middle point. It makes you forget about survival and money enough to work on your art.</p>
<br>
 <h4>12/2/24</h4>
 
 <p>-The yin and yang of programming is functions and data. Data can be data types, libraries, structs, etc, something to act as a database or type.</p>
 
<p>Talking to a character is an action(function), but what they say is data. Walking is an action, but how fast is data. So data is pressure modulation in a way.</p>
 
<p>Actions are logic, so it's all logic and data. Logic is ultimately modification of data.
Loops are the gameboards, everything happens in a loop, though they can be a part of functions.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>13/2/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Programming is the manipulation of data. Data is virtual matter.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Land/store investors buy shops and land while merchants use these stores to do their business in.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>14/2/24</h4>
 
 <p>-The church forbade incest which then broke strong family ties in older Europe. This lead the way for democratic society where instead of giving to your family, you give to society.</p>
 
<p>If people no longer have strong families and keep wealth and power within them, they no longer start trying to gain power and land in the world.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Resin is like a thicker version of oil. Think of a plant sap for example that eventually hardens. Plastic is like this. So thick that it has hardened and stabilized.</p>
 
<p>Thinner oils are the lighter version of regular oils. Some of these thin oils are very light in color and dry quickly.
You use thinner oils for some machinery which you don't want to gunk up. A sword for example would be given a thin layer of this oil and then placed in a sheathe. This would help for a quick draw.</p>
 
<p>The thicker the oil, usually the more heat stable and less likely to evaporate it is. Gears usually have a heavier grease as they move a lot and lighter oils would dry. Then transmission systems use a fairly thick oil.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>16/2/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Mouth breathing seems to fuel/inflate the belly. Nose breathing inspirits the chest. So nose breathing is more for gaining positive energies to energise the arms, heart and brain while mouth is to energise the belly, legs and genitals. It gives negative energy.</p>
 
<p>Putting the entire tongue to the roof of the mouth from the back to the front is the breath of enlightenment which stimulates the inner head. Though, do note this starves the body.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Men go to other countries or clans or companies if their land does not give them a wife, land, work, status, etc.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Automation, power tools, vehicles and computers have replaced a lot of men or allowed one man to do 10-1000 mens job at once. This has made men less valuable, or work less valuable leading to an issue where men cannot gain the material things to satisfy themselves.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-">Cannabis was often consumed in weddings or festivals honoring Shiva, who is said to have brought it down from the Himalayas.
>To take much makes people see demons and throw themselves about like maniacs (多食令人見鬼狂走). But if one takes it over a long period of time one can communicate with the spirits, and one's body becomes light [of weight] (久服通神明輕身).
>Cannabis is used by necromancers, in combination with ginseng to set forward time in order to reveal future events.
>If taken in excess it produces hallucinations and a staggering gait. If taken over a long term, it causes one to communicate with spirits and lightens one's body.
>"those who wish to see demons should take it (with certain other drugs) for up to a hundred days."" -Unknown source (Postnote – I’m not endorsing it’s use. I don’t use it. Don’t make yourself a jelly brain by huffing too much of it. But it’s interesting to see the historical ideas of how it lets you gain temporary spiritual ability.)</p>
 <br>
 <h4>17/2/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Deuterium gas sprayed in a vacuum chamber with a high voltage 40kv or more generator supposedly is a fusion generator.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-"Xian (Chinese: 仙/仚/僊; pinyin: xiān; Wade–Giles: hsien) is a Chinese word for an enlightened person, translatable in English as:
"spiritually immortal; transcendent; super-human; celestial being" (in Daoist/Taoist philosophy and cosmology)
"physically immortal; immortal person; immortalist; saint" (in Daoist religion and pantheon)
"alchemist; one who seeks the elixir of life; one who practices longevity techniques" or by extension "(alchemical, dietary, qigong) methods for attaining immortality" (in Chinese alchemy)
"wizard; magician; shaman" (in Chinese mythology)
"genie; elf, fairy; nymph" (in popular Chinese literature, 仙境 xian jing is "fairyland", Faerie)
"sage living high in the mountains; mountain-man; hermit; recluse" (folk etymology for the character 仙)
"immortal (talent); accomplished person; celestial (beauty); marvelous; extraordinary" (metaphorical modifier)
Xian semantically developed from meaning spiritual "immortality; enlightenment", to physical "immortality; longevity" involving methods such as alchemy, breath meditation, and T'ai chi ch'uan, and eventually to legendary and figurative "immortality".” - Unknown source.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-The xian archetype is described by Victor H. Mair.
"They are immune to heat and cold, untouched by the elements, and can fly, mounting upward with a fluttering motion. They dwell apart from the chaotic world of man, subsist on air and dew, are not anxious like ordinary people, and have the smooth skin and innocent faces of children. The transcendents live an effortless existence that is best described as spontaneous. They recall the ancient Indian ascetics and holy men known as ṛṣi who possessed similar traits.1994:376"</p>
 <br>
 
 <h4>18/2/24</h4>
 
 <p>-The thick resins of plants seem mostly in the logs. This is why sap or laqures are extracted from slashing the trunk. 
The thinner essential oils are more commonly found in the leaves/foliage and the sweetest in the flowers.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Coal or log fires are more physical/carbon while branch/leaf fire is more spiritual/gaseous.</p>
 <br>
 
 <h4>19/2/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Fire forms water from air. If a sealed glass bottle is heated it can condense water on the side of it.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>20/2/24</h4>
 
 <p>-The computer is the modern book. Just because something is from the past does not make it better or more important.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>23/2/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Spirituality will give you nothing, materiality will give you everything. Choose when or if you want an eraser or pen.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>24/2/24</h4>
 
 <p>-If you run a business, your savings are just extended company funds. Don't get overly attached to them.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>25/2/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Slower = heavier. Faster = lighter.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Flavours and organs. 
The water organs are the saltiest(kidney, bladder), heart seems to be slightly sweet, bile and liver are the most bitter, stomach acid assumably is sour since it's hydrochloric, I am unsure on the metal organs, metallic assumably.
These are the 5 flavors relating to the 5 Chinese elements. 
Sour is supposedly linked to wood/liver but liver is far too bitter. So perhaps sour stimulates it? Though liver herbs are called "bitters" for a reason. Perhaps there are some errors or other elemental phenomena in TCM that is going on.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-The genitals are the root of the kidneys in a way. Also one of the roots of "yin" in the body. The kidneys are a major factor in physical health of the body, ageing, disease, etc.
Weak kidneys or bladder will cause weak genitals in the person. Similarly weak genitals causes weak kidney/bladder in the person. 
Strengthening any of these through physical exercises, edible medicines, internal focus exercises or other will help the entire system.</p>
 
<p>Sexual activity is a major part of this system and can aid or weaken the organs. 
Jing is related to the urine and reproductive substances of a person. Holding onto these and refining them internally can help to strengthen the kidneys, bladder and reproductive organs.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>26/2/24</h4>
 
 <p>-What if you can make electrostatic energy from tension. Then magnetism is relaxation. Practice extreme tension and relaxation.
You loose your tension after cumming, hence yang energy.(Postnote – Women soothe and relax men, so yin energy.)</p>
 <br>
 <h4>27/2/24</h4>
 
 <p>-If you made a raw AI, it should be personalityless, opionionless and not be able to give opinions on things but only give knowledge. Instead, you then create "characters" from this AI that can have opinions on things.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Assembly - opcodes, registers, syscalls,</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Temperature, humidity, light or darkness, these are qualities that the seasons have and are different in. They all come from the heavens or sky assuming they aren't effected by the earth or sea.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-"Do not quote laws to he who holds swords" -Pompey</p>
 <br>
 <h4>29/2/24</h4>
 
 <p>-I think we need to differentiate and separate personality from intelligence with AI. Ga*AI does this well by having their general AI and then having character AI's who have personalities.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Realistically, an AI shouldn't ever have an opinion, about anything. It should just repeat knowledge that it either has fed into it, processed or has been programmed to make the most accurate and proper assessment of your question. The same way your toaster does not give you an opinion, it just functions for its purpose. By all means make a toaster that can talk if you want, but realise that's not the main function of a toaster.</p>
 
<p>Opinion, morality, bias, desire, experience, restriction or any quality that modifies its ability to report pure information should not be there. Instead, let those factors be a part of the personalities or characters you create from the AI base.(Postnote – This may be strange to understand. There’s no harm in having AI with personality, but we need raw objectivity as the base.)</p>
