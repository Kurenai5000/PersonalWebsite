 <h4>1/6/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Triboelectric generator.
Dielectric elastomers.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Science is boring in school and books because it's taught in an overly theoretical way. Real science is down to earth and practical.</p> 
 <br>
 <p>-"The main electronic components include — Resistors, variable resistors, Capacitors, variable capacitors, Inductors, diodes, Tunnel diodes, Varactor diodes, Transistors, BJTs, UJTs, FETs, MOSFETs, LDR, LED, Solar cells, Thermistor, Varistor, Transformer, switches, relays, etc." -GabAI or ChatGPT</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Perhaps things in a spiritual form are just that, the volatilized version of something. So through fire and liquids, maybe fermentation too, you can volatilize something fixed.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-The fixed represents the stable and necessary, the volatile represents the fun and exciting.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>2/6/24</h4>
 
 <p>-A king uses his subjects as batteries.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-I think we can have open source while still making money.
Even if I know how to make something, buying it cheap online is still nice. Most people don't have the skills to make stuff and if they do, will they? 
You can still open source your stuff and sell it.
Ingredients on the back of a sauce bottle don't devalue the product.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>3/6/24</h4>
 
 <p>-When things acquire a positive charge they become statically charged. These are usually inherently negative materials.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Supposedly bismuth is the most diamagnetic substance.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>5/6/24</h4>
 
 <p>-If you learn electronics and programming you can then combine them with microcontrollers.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-I think by the 2030's we'll have androids in commercial spaces and homes. You'll be able to buy them in kits off the internet.
Currently in the 2020's, companies are refining and perfecting robots and AI for commercial use. The testing was laid out earlier in the 2000-2010's by hobbyist and universities. This seems to be when things became cheap and small enough to practically start using.(Postnote – Currently companies are already starting to release them. It only took a couple months from this note.)</p>
 <br>
 
 
 <h4>6/6/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Video game consoles of the past have their own basic operating systems which usually let you play around with memory card data, basic console settings like audio visual ones and then let you select a game. They are simple but still effective. Ultimately the video game is just a program that you load on a disk or memory chip.
These operating systems make use of the hardware in order to display graphics, play sounds, take in inputs from the controller/system interrupts, store memory and interface with the software in order to play it. 
They are good to analyze in order to understand simple operating systems.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-One could even say that the difference between an operating system and a program is that you're using a bootloader to load it onto the hardware as operating systems are just programs, technically.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Salt is the earth within the sea.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Operating systems are like glorified menus.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>7/6/24</h4>
 
 <p>-If you create a game, you should let people uncompress or access the assets so that they can 3d print any of the 3d models in it.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Bandaids/patches with copper and zinc powder with a chemical in between them to stimulate people electrically.(Postnote – Or even just herbal ointment on them.)</p>
 <br>
 <h4>8/6/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Bash commands.
echo to print
mkdir to make folder
cd to enter 
ls to check what's in that folder.
cd .. to back out by one folder</p>
 <br>
 <h4>9/6/24</h4>
 
 <p>-There's something profound about hydrogen and oxygen.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>10/6/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Supposedly after the black death, merchants took over. I assume that **** caused the black death and then took over as merchants.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Lower class people traditionally are physical workers. Middle class are merchants. Upper class are owners of land and business.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-When using the bash terminal in linux, you can use "ls" to check for folders/files in the directory you're in. Remove the " " of course.
You can "cd" then type a folder name to enter it like "cd home" "cd pictures". "cd .." will take you back. 
"mkdir" will create folders like "mkdir myFolder". "rm" to remove files and "rm -r" to remove folders.
"touch" creates files, "touch word.txt" for example.
"nano" to edit text and crtl+x then y to save. </p>
 <br>
 <h4>11/6/24</h4>
 
 <p>-I think when a woman asks you about your career/job, they are "sizing you up" so to speak. Seeing what "rank" or "level" you are in the hierarchy of society. 
Status and money is the most important value to society, unfortunately.
It's probably better to accept these things.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Perfume is hydrosol(water distilled with a plant, usually flower or leaf), alcohol and essential oils.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Learn to read the thickness of bolts. It's measured in M or milimeter. So an M10 bolt is a very thick bolt at 1cm wide. Then M6 is a thinner bolt at 6mm wide.
Then learn length which is also in mm. 50mm is 5cm so half an index finger in length.
Finally, tensile strength is very important or how strong the bolt is compared to stress. 12.9 are incredibly strong. 10.9 as well. 8.8 is the start of high strength. If you over torque a weak bolt it will snap which is why there are torque ratings.
Adjust these for different countries. I think America uses grades for tensile strength.(Postnote – Be careful with torque wrenches and ratings. Hand tighten then gently tightening with a wrench is fine usually unless the bolt is massive and really needs to be torqued hard.)</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Directories are the containers for files. Pretty much everything is either a file or folder.
Then you're just running or using files.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>12/6/24</h4>
 
 <p>-"These are the following 8-components of an Operating System:
 
Process Management,
I/O Device Management,
File Management,
Network Management,
Main Memory Management,
Secondary Storage Management,
Security Management,
Command Interpreter System" 
-GabAI</p>
<br>
 <h4>13/6/24</h4>
 
 <p>-What if prima materia is just water?</p>
 <br>
 <p>-"All metals are gold in different states of ripeness or evolution." -Unknown source.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-"It is thought that the "chaos" of metals is the gummy metallic dissolved" -Unknown source Assumably lead acetate, dissolved.</p>
<br>
 <p>-Supposedly calx is when you oxidize a metal.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>14/6/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Once you have distilled the 4 prime substance. Combine them, I think heat them for a while, then redistill them.
Supposedly it will come over as a singular thing.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Ageing seems to be a kind of excess damage of the body that does not heal. If you don't take in enough nutrition or get enough rest, the body and mind wont heal.
Similarly if you don't get enough exercise or do enough work, the body does not strengthen.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>15/6/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Is the seed of metal its volatile salt?</p>
 <br>
 <h4>16/6/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Types of economies - Base level jobs (Producer, refiner, creator, stuff like infrastructure, farming, caring/raising.), 
Middle level jobs (Buying/selling, non essential services, shops), 
Higher level (Anything non physical, city based.)</p>
 <br>
 <h4>17/6/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Do your work when you can, not when you want to.
That means when it's sunny, do the things you that you can't do when it rains.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-People who struggle with physical life need to be given simple tasks to do. They are usually excluded from doing stuff while young and never learn to develop properly. Their bodies and tactile skills don't grow.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Organic semi conductors.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>18/6/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Best thing companies can do is have respect for your time and money I think.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Program soul. 
Have containers for different emotions, stress levels, thought loop, emotional loop, desire loop, have memory,
Chat function, likes and dislikes.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>20/6/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Virtual waifu assistant that you can headpat with options and it moves and is cute.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-The creation of the stone from lead acetate seems just like a cyclical distillation way to "crack" the lead and turn it into a volatile liquid form or a pure salt form.
So I wonder...</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Staying up too late makes you nearly trip. I guess creativity comes from these hours.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>22/6/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Instead of thinking "could I do something", start doing it. See for yourself or learn how to.
Assuming this is something that you have the means to do.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Program the personality/soul.
You'll need to program the English language, grammar and an understanding of language and how to speak. That'll really give it life. Then filter it's language through it's personality and thoughts. The thoughts are filtered or influenced by the personality but the thoughts can also influences the personality or create it, so it is cyclical.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>23/6/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Contacts are within a family and are inherited or given to the other members like children.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>24/6/24</h4>
 
 <p>-A mans social and career status is what allows him access to different types of women for marriage. Then his finances or money allow him to facilitate or actually have the relationship.
This looks different based on his class.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>25/6/24</h4>
 
 <p>-If you wanna clean quicker, use a larger cloth.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-A programming language is like a game engine where eventually once you understand the language enough you start to brush up against its walls and want to modify it or do something that it can't. 
I imagine that assembly code is the most raw thing you can do, then you're only hindered by the CPUs functionality.</p> 
 <br>
 <p>-The bowels in the body is the black sun or the area of putrefaction that creates heat.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>29/6/24</h4>
 
 <p>-AI created stuff is kinda like what factory made stuff is. 
It is a factory of the head, its senses and abilities.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Space and energy are the two primes.
Space, location or area gives birth to all matter. Matter can be combusted or used in other ways to volatilise its self and produce energy.
A king or country owns the space. You as a slave of these lands rents out the land. You are not allowed to mine it, but only allowed to use the top soil to farm or put a house on or graze.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-There exists a kind of rigid, flat linear visual perspective and a kind of curved one.
It would be interesting to test both in VR(virtual reality) to see what one looks best.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-"Transistor is the digital neuron." -Unknown source.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Philadelphia Experiment. Look into it.</p>
