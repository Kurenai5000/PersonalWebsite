 <h4>1/7/24</h4>
 
 <p>-I think because everything is so much more advanced and complicated today that it takes longer for people to reach a "middle ground" where you've "seen everything twice" so to speak. At that point it becomes a lot easier to function and learn, in society or else wise as you don't have to continuously reconstruct a worldview because of all of the new layers of information that you haven't yet understood or seen enough. 
Hence the young may seem deficient because of this, but probably it's that they have to process and learn far more things than people of previous generations and wont properly have a foothold in life till later.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-The idea of managing your own house before someone elses is that if you can do your own gardening, you can do it for another person. If you can fix your own house, you can fix someone elses.
-The ability to run a successful household probably relates to your ability to run a successful business. Then you can look at someones life and think if they'd be proper because of what is happening at home.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-I find it hard to drift off into fantasy when there are real life problems to solve.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Plants seem to be attracted or grow where water is.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>2/7/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Giving regular people access to the internet and computers is giving them access to the psychic parts of the mind but through technology.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-To be a man is to endure endless pain without ever being able to give up.
The masculine drive either forces you to keep going and to break or to succeed.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Magnetism and electricity is archetypal relaxation and tension of nature.</p> 
 <br>
 <p>-Maybe water is related to relaxation, earth to hyper relaxation. Then air would be lesser or weak tension and fire, intense tension.
Electrostatic as ultimate tension and "gravity" as ultimate relaxation.
Perhaps the opposites create them, but they generate those effects? 
Cold makes us tense while heat makes us warm.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-If you know how to do something for yourself, your own house, then you can either do it for others (this is the basis of service business) or teach them to do it. 
This is how you help yourself and then help the world.
Similarly if you figure out how to do things outside of your own world, or not for yourself, then you can do it for yourself once you've learned.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>3/7/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Red, green, blue make all colors. Are there primary smells that can make all smells?</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Few miliamp current pulses sent to the olfactory bulb of the nose can stimulate smell.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Chemical is analog, electrical is digital. 
Or chemical is physical, electrical is spiritual.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Trigeminal nerve can also sense smell. This is less invasive to stimulate electronically.
Try to wirelessly stimulate the nose nerves.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-From what I understand, either stimulating the olfactory bulb or the trigeminal nerve in the nose with miliamp current electrical pulses can cause smell sensations.
This is fairly invasive as it requires an electrode to be stuck up the nerve and to touch delicate areas. I imagine that wireless pulse transfer devices could send "smell signals" to your nose just like how a speaker sends sound through the air.</p>
 
<p>Chemical smell would be like painting with colors to make all kinds of senses, but it isn't virtual or non physical like electrical is.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>4/7/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Electrified electrodes placed on different areas of the body can stimulate them.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-DC open circuit electrodes with low voltage can stimulate any part of the body. You can put them on your tongue to stimulate taste, in the nose to enhance breathing or in the ears for hearing. They can be put on the body to help stimulate that area, arms for example for an injury or soreness.</p> 
 <br>
 <p>-Taste, back side of the tongue is sour or gag reflect, front is sweet, front side is salty, back side is sour.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Inductors smooth current, capacitors smooth voltage.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Frequency controls motor speed, amplitude controls power.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>5/7/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Learn to segment things up in your mind or in a journal. Break down a complex task into it's major components or things that need to be done. Put them into numbered steps for what needs to be done first. Then focus on that step only.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-The menu based combat in FFXI is great. 
Japanese games used more menu based systems while American games and European used gameplay based systems and mechanics.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Repression of painful areas of the body will not help them heal but pass it off for later. Many people in todays world seem to be nothing but an entire body of repression. They avoid every bad or uncomfortable situation in their lives and pass it off onto another person. This stops them from being able to be at ease, at peace within themselves.
Feel into the pained areas, this will begin the healing process.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>6/7/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Women are like batteries, men are like generators.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-If you be, relax, be natural and allow your energy to circulate however it wants to. This takes you down the path of your own destiny. Without any mental wilful interference you will act cyclically and do what was chosen for you by your family, country, local area, physical body and other circumstances. </p>
 
<p>To consciously choose to change this natural flow or circulation within you and to focus on other areas or to consciously choose your actions, set up new routines, break old habits will then put you on a course to a new destination in life.</p>
 
<p>Taking control of your own life can lead it into a toilet as much as letting your natural course run can too. Hence we then can also learn to change our passive flow of energy to be more aligned with our will and desires instead of what was given to us.
Through experience, trial and error you will find what works and know how to direct yourself to where you want to go.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>7/7/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Different metals seem to produce different flavors.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Maybe causing certain metals to oscillate can produce a smell, then having a bunch of different metals oscillating or emitting emf could make complex smells.
Spark gaps even or heating the metal could work too to produce smells.
The same metals for the smell one will work for the taste one, maybe.
Other materials like maybe electro polymers or anything else electrically conductive could work too.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Electronics is using metal or metalic, semi metalic and mineral products to control reality.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Think physically, think materially to understand the material world.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>9/7/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Green vegetation seems to grow above the soil layer. Below the vegetation and top soil is clay, sand and dirt. The only vegetation down there are roots and root vegetables. 
So seemingly when water and air meet earth, vegetation is born as it will passively grow on the top soil with enough water.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Structure or shape and materials. Two major parts of physical things.
And then the interactions of phenomena these things cause when put together is another interesting idea of study.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Synthesizer technology is the generator or creator of sound. I think any sound can be created by using it.</p>
 <br>
 
 
 <h4>11/7/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Conductive paint. Oil and metal powder I think.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>12/7/24</h4>
 
 <p>-"Reactors" make things react or combine in them.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>13/7/24</h4>
 
 <p>-There's nothing more miserable than being around a miserable guy. Unfortunately, bad life experiences, crush them and turn them into that.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>16/7/24</h4>
 
 <p>-I wonder if the bones house magnetism in the body.
Maybe the muscles or nerves house the electrostatic?(Postnote – Could even be muscles as they hold a lot of water, or fat too.)</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Knowledge of the stars, of the sky/weather, of the earth and physical things.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>17/7/24</h4>
 
 <p>-We could analyse scent with alchemical categorisations like animalistic, herbal and mineral smells. Then using basic categorisation like lower smells, mid smell and higher-sharper or sweeter smells.
Otherwise elemental categorisation is one form too. Earthly, dirty, heavy, dusty smells, sour-watery-salty smells, airy-herby-minty-fresh-sweet smells, harsh-spicey-burnt-stimulating smells.</p>
 
<p>But how do we gain a proper understanding. Looking at the biology of the nose, its sensors and nerves for example might help similar to how the tongue is broken down into sweet, salty, savoury, sour and bitter.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Perhaps we can look into atoms. Supposedly most of all smells are made up of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen and sulfur. Most used to make common organic molecules.</p>
  <br>
 <p>-Shape and molecular vibrations are two ideas of smells.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>18/7/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Bricks in houses are usually not structural elements but to keep them weathered.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>19/7/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Crude oil was used to waterproof wood.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Sweet - Copper, Aluminium</p>
<p>Salty - Silver, Steel</p>
<p>Savour - Silver, Steel</p>
<p>Sour - Copper, Titanium</p>
<p>Bitter - Copper, Aluminium, Titanium, Steel,</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Women are a physical representation of nature.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-This tech error today has made me think that society can collapse because it does not want to integrate competent, eccentric outcasts who do new things or different things but instead people who just keep the status quo.(Postnote – The same issues as having a genetic monocrop of plants.)</p>
 <br>
 <h4>20/7/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Seemingly the smaller your electronics, the more margin or error there is.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-The combustion engine turns linear up and down force into power.
The electromagnetic engine turns rational force into power.
These are the two main forms of moving force, linear and cyclical or round.
They both can be turned into each through special mechanisms.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Use AI to endlessly generate scroll content.(Postnote – virtual hell.)</p>
 <br>
 <h4>21/7/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Ball joints.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Engineered goods like l*go that are endlessly connectable.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Multiculturalism usually does not work very well in society.
What has worked is people of close cultural backgrounds that integrate into one or other society. Integration is key in this idea. If a certain race immigrates in but does not integrate into the dominant culture religiously, physically, lingually, etc then they cause an issue in the dominant culture. 
What we have now in first world countries are many selfish racial groups who no longer want to integrate but instead fight for their own racial groups power. This creates internal tension.</p>
 <br>
  <p>-Deep underground there might be strong magnetic energies that can be harvested.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>22/7/24</h4>
 
 <p>-I notice that the older men who are now fathers of young men did not self improve and fix their issues and are like children to a degree.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Supposedly collagen is electrically conductive. The body is like an electromagnetic field made physical.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-What puts the body into action is the will or assumingly the nervous system.
So then practicing force projection and willing the body is a kind of training for this force/will.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>23/7/24</h4>
 
 <p>-I imagine yang energy is just tension. Then yin is relaxation.</p>
 <br>
 
 <h4>25/7/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Electrical integrated plastics or plastic electronics components.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-There are some shapes that defy nature and God by their own nature. They are illogical and in that, they hold great power.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>26/7/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Hydrogen peroxide and vinegar make peracetic/peroxyacetic acid.(Postnote – It’s an easier way to dissolve most metals without having to oxidise them before when you want to dissolve them in vinegar.)</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Things fail gradually then suddenly.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Feminine forces like the rain and cold bring things down and make it heavier.
Masculine rise it up like heat and wind.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Figure out how to condense your thoughts. Extract the essence and salt from your knowledge and experience then condense it into a pearl.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-I hope that medical care becomes purified and that we use proper methods to cure disease and illness instead of pills and surgery that mask or temporarily make it better.
Ultimately people must awaken true healing within themselves and learn to understand what is proper verses what is not.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-The heart desires and the mind restrains. Past traumas cause the mind to guard the heart, this slowly cuts off your connection with the outside world. 
All alone in a self made prison of restraint. But the opposite is to be rocked against the waves of life, fraying your soul.
To not push the pendulum of life makes you safe but miserable. Pushing it causes pain, though also relief. 
None are pleasant. Perhaps we just have to choose the option that we want the most if you have the abilities to sustain or make it happen. Else save your energy for another day.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>27/7/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Being in survival mode burns bridges and the more bridges you burn, the more isolated you become and go into survival mode.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-The use of ash might help to crystallise/physicalise things.
I assume using carbonates would help to make fixed/solid salts while hydroxides would work for volatile salts.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Ash adds the earth element to soils.(Postnote – I imagine carbon too.)</p>
 <br>
 <p>-It doesn't matter if I can't win. I'd still rather try.</p>
 <br>
 
 <h4>28/7/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Increasing temperature for 3d prints seem to make them stronger. Too high a temperature will warp your print quality. Go up in 5 degree tests. Do know that this also makes your supports stronger, so be careful with that.</p>
 
<p>Wider, lower angles or bases also help for strength in parts.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>30/7/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Iron supposedly is a heat catalyst.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-I think that cultivating mana is to focus on the mid head. It seems to want to happen during night time.
Then the energy goes into the body during day.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Self destructive impulses come in at points of high tension and stress usually. They are a way to offgas or release pressure by destroying your responsibilities to free yourself. 
This is an unconscious drive, seemingly. Instead, become comfortable with pressure and responsibility, learn to handle it.(Postnote – People who get very angry or blow up show this kind of behaviour. They do not handle their emotions and internal pressures but instead exert it outward at others.)</p>
 <br>
 <p>-If you get rid of something, it may not come back easily. So choose your life carefully.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>31/7/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Most things if kept away from the weather and maintained will last. 
When left outside and not greased or lacquered will start to degrade.
Using something regularly enough can also help it to last.</p>
