 <p>-What you're allowed to do as a man is dictated by your status. What is seen of as disgusting from one man is beautiful from another.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Status is probably an external marker of an internal thing.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Exercises and supplements are basic paths to immortality.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-To relate men and women to cars, tools or other things.
Men are more valuable when tested, stress tested. Women are more valuable when new, fresh.<p>
 <br>

 <h4>2/4/24</h4>
 
 <p>-The desire for women is the ultimate motivator for men to work and seek status.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Entertainment is born out of lots of time. You could think of it as something born out of lots of time that eats up your time while entertaining you.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>3/4/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Cultivate the foundation first in order to hold the elixir.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>4/4/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Chess is spoken highly of but it is just a game. Books are spoken highly of but they are just old entertainment or records of knowledge.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>5/4/24</h4>
 
 <p>-I think that the back of the body is Capricorn and the front is Cancer. Left side is Aries and right is Libra.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-On Saturnian or dark energies - 
Graveyards are places of immense peace and rest. They are seemingly cold and give off a sense of night time, detached from the rest of the world. This is Saturnian or dark energy. To mourn is to channel energy downward like water raining down into the ground.</p>
 
<p>Black is color of this and is worn at funerals or is symbolic to mourning. 
Lead is the metal of Saturn and acts as an anti-anxiety and anti-psychotic. 
Deep winter and midnight as well as the new moon are its times. 
Heavy foods and pork are Saturinain. 
Weight and downward pressure, the northern direction. 
To sleep is the action, death as well.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>6/4/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Turn bolts/screws slowly but with high torque/strength and inward pressure if you're worried around threading them if they're stuck. I find sometimes this works.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Old games teach you to just keep playing when you die or loose. Eventually you just get used to it and figure out how to win.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Maybe magic is just understanding the elements, and physics.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Maybe we can emulate nature to perform magic.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-A alchemists emulates nature in the way that gems are formed but can a magician also emulate nature in how the wind blows, sun shines and waves rush.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>7/4/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Jaw positions - Jaw open and tongue down is water. Jaw closed and tongue down is earth. Tongue up and jaw open is air. Tongue up and jaw closed is fire. Jaw open and tongue down with mouth open might be void.</p>
 
<p>These positions like hand signs send your subconscious focus or energy to certain areas of the body relating to these elements.(Postnote – Subject to debate on the mouth position and element link.)</p>
 <br>
 <p>-If you ain't willing to look stupid, you wont have fun dancing.</p>
 <br>
 
 
 <h4>8/4/24</h4>
 
 <p>-When urine ferments in open air it eventually turns alkaline.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-"When you dissolve meat protein in hydrochloric acid (HCl), you are performing protein hydrolysis, which breaks down the peptide bonds between the amino acids in the protein, releasing individual amino acids and smaller peptides. The final products are a mixture of amino acids and smaller peptides. When you dissolve meat protein in lye (sodium hydroxide or NaOH), you are performing saponification, which primarily targets ester bonds found in fats and oils, not the peptide bonds in proteins. This process is typically used for breaking down fats and oils into glycerol and fatty acid salts, known as soap. As a result, saponification with lye is not a suitable method for producing amino acids and peptides from proteins. In summary, dissolving meat protein in HCl results in a mixture of amino acids and smaller peptides, while dissolving meat protein in lye results in soap and is not an effective method for producing amino acids and peptides." -ChatGPT.(Postnote, this is about animal alchemy or turning organs to amino acids and other parts.)</p>
 <br>
 <p>-"When you add ethanol to the dissolved meat protein solution, the amino acids and peptides will typically precipitate out of the solution, while the impurities will remain dissolved in the liquid. The impurities are not necessarily liquid; they could be solid or semi-solid. However, the ethanol will help separate the amino acids and peptides from the impurities by causing them to precipitate. The precipitation of amino acids and peptides depends on the specific conditions, such as the concentration of ethanol, temperature, and the presence of other substances in the solution. In some cases, the amino acids and peptides may also remain dissolved in the liquid. After the ethanol is added, you can proceed with the filtration step to separate the precipitate (containing amino acids and peptides) from the liquid (containing ethanol and other impurities). This will help you isolate and purify the amino acids and peptides for further use or analysis." -ChatGPT.</p>

 <h4>9/4/24</h4>
 
 <p>-The brain and nervous system are probably the organs of the 5th element. They allow and open the gates of or for chaos allowing you to reprogram yourself.
Maybe we could see these as the fire organs or system. Either fire or electromagnetism.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-"A.—I will. Take urine, and dissolve in it a convenient quantity of saltpetre. Let it stand a month; afterwards distil it, and there will come over a spirit which burns upon the tongue like a coal of fire. Pour this spirit on again, and cohobate it four or five times, abstracting every time not above half; so the spirit becometh most piercing, yet not in the least sharp; the heat which goeth out in the first distillation of the liquor, afterwards grows sensibly mild, and at length almost (if not altogether) vanisheth, and the second spirit may be perceived mild, both by the smell and taste, which in the former was most sharp." -Unkown source.
(Postnote – You can mix urine and sodium or potassium hydroxide, let it sit for a week or so and distil it to make “spirit of urine”, ammonia. Saltpeter/nitrate salts and urine might make an ammonium nitrate or make more ammonia?)</p>
 <br>
 <h4>10/4/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Break things into steps and only focus on step 1 first. Like measuring up the wood you want to cut. Forget about the table or chair it will become, just measure it for now. Then cut it, then nail it, then finish it.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Most people act like dramatic characters in movies or tv shows because that's all they do or watch. I see life like a game because I want to win and surpass. I guess I just got tired of loosing.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-People always seem to notice new things but not old things. If you've worn something forever then no one cares. If it's new then they do.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>11/4/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Nature and our food is a cyclical system. The rain cycles and also the earth. As things die they return to the earth and feed what grows from it. The minerals feed the plants and the plants feed the animals which then again feeds the earth which feeds the plants, etc.
It's a closed loop system. We've externalized energy creation, processing, generation in a way by growing food. Food grown with more minerals/nutrients will be better quality and nourish you more than that without it.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-In the lab you can chemically digest food into its essences, salts and other properties. In this way you are externalizing digestion.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Minerals are probably the most nutrient dense foods but they are also the hardest to digest. If made potable would give man near immortality or perfect health and power by virtue of their nutrition I assume.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Keeping stuff in a sealed container and keeping it heated may be able to slowly transform it chemically like perhaps adding some vinegar to a mineral to change it.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>12/4/24</h4>
 
 <p>-What if lesbianism is mommy issues?(Postnote – Or Daddy issues.)</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Chemistry explains purified refinements or transformations/transmutations of matter and spirit.
Alchemy understands the natural and slow transformations of these as the processes back in the past were not quite as precise or refined but perhaps a bit more gentle and emulated nature.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-When I use my imagination I seem to create energy. Focusing on a space mentally is good practice, then turn that into changing temperatures, pressure, weight, etc.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>13/4/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Instead of looking at systems and applying anatomy to it I started looking at anatomy and then applied systems to it.</p>
<br>
 <h4>14/4/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Learned how to do riveting today.
You drill a hole in two bits of plate relating to the size of the rivet like 4mm, then put a rivet in the gun and hole, press it and it'll squish to bind them together.</p>
 
<p>Works well to securely bind plastic I found.
Similar to a blacksmith rivet where they heat brass or a soft metal small rod then insert it into two materials and hammer it till it flattens and squishes, filling the hole.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>15/4/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Wheat when fermented smells like sperm. We are eating the plant sperm when we eat grains. Maybe eating roots or other parts of plants would be a better idea.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Acetone is the ketone of vinegar.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>17/4/24</h4>
 
 <p>-There is a beauty in objects and geometry.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-When you go into a hardware store, realize that all of the tools are just different manipulations of the elements. Different devices that use air, heat, fire, water, pressure, vibration, spinning, specialized objects/shapes.</p>
 
<p>Then things like nails and bolts or screws are just different shapes, hardness, material types, lengths, thickness, etc of a similar thing with a similar purpose. These all control the function and use of it. 
Even resin, silicons, epoxies and such are similar in that regard where some are to be water proof or shock proof or some other quality.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Maybe the same way that bread is made to rise, plastic could be made. Similarly most things could be made in similar ways perhaps.(Postnote – Look into urethane rubber/foam.)</p>
 <br>
 <h4>20/4/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Nuts, bolts, screws, gears, motor connectors, joints, wheels.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>21/4/24</h4>
 
 <p>-In life we slowly learn and evolve, grow and figure new stuff out. New builds upon the old which acts as a framework. Life is an exploration of physics or understanding the physical elements and the world which is based on math or pattern. 
There are invisible patterns behind everything that forms the world we live in. To understand the patterns then allows you to understand the physical world and all things since it is based on it. Hence then everything becomes the same, all art and skills become one as they are just an exploration of the origin of life, the patterns which make all things.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>22/4/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Cars and other vehicles are technology that replicates and enhances the function of the legs. 
Phones and computers emulate functions of the head/throat. Power and hand tools of the hands.</p>
 
<p>Technology is analogous to the human body. Then you could also say it's related to elements as well as tools are machines that use elemental qualities to achieve their purpose as a vacuum cleaner uses air, the suction form of it while a leaf blower uses the opposite blowing function of it.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>23/4/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Magic is all related to the mind and the energy world.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>25/4/24</h4>
 
 <p>-I'm starting to think that intelligence can get you what you want. It's a far more round about way and abstract way to do things but it is a path.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-You're now conscious of all of the forgotten things and areas in your house. The things that go completely unseen and unnoticed that are probably dusty or locked away in a drawer or corner.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Intelligence or using your mind is a path to solving your problems. Work them out in your head and apply it to reality. One of many ways.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Learn to work past sickness, weakness, discomfort, pain. It's good to know when to rest and take it easy but you don't always have that luxury.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Anyone else notice that life glitches when you get too close to something it doesn't want to you to get close to?</p>
 <br>
 <h4>27/4/24</h4>
 
 <p>-When burning wood, the fire produced is from the oil. Vapour is from the water and it leaves residual ash.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-For true equality, to elevate those who are lesser you need to squish down or cut down those who are higher. So equality cannot exist with people who excel too far and with those who fall too far down.(Postnote – Hence balance is found in imbalance. Find a point of peace within the moment to see it.)</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Perhaps chaos is a portal to the soul. That might be a way to make robots conscious.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>28/4/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Ball bearings, pulley cables and gears, measurement clamps.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Quality and amount are two poles of production. If you make too much, work on refining the quality. If you work too much on the quality, learn to make more.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>29/4/24</h4>
 
 <p>-3d printed ball joint figures.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>30/4/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Supposedly the church dug underground tunnels for tax evasion and espionage. They are ****. The same **** that control now are the ones that used to control using Christianity in the past.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-"All diseases are rooted in the blood, and the blood is the product of food. Therefore, in order to cure the disease, we must first understand the food and its effect on the blood. The blood is the sap of the body, and urine is the sap of the blood." -Paracelsus.</p>
