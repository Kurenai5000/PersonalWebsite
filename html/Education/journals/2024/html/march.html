 <h4>1/3/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Supposedly carburetted engines that take in oxygen suffer in low oxygen environments like the high mountains due to lack of oxygen.
You can also directly inject or pump in oxygen from a gas canister.</p>
<br>
 <p>-Liquefying animal materials with hydroxides turns them into amino acids supposedly. Then you could use an acid to neutralise it.</p>
 
  <h4>2/3/24</h4>

 <p>-Jelly lets you eat water.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>3/3/24</h4>
 
 <p>-You can grease your zippers to help them from getting tight.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-I think orgone has something to do with electrostatics, the idea of layering metal and non metal and how it seems to effect metal in water.(Postnote – Seemingly I was able to use an electrostatic accumulator to perform electrolysis which gathered crystals around the metal placed in water.)</p>
 <br>
 <h4>4/3/24</h4>
 
 <p>-I can only get a freshly blown balloon to produce static electricity by rubbing it against my hair. Old ones don't seem to work.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>5/3/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Lightning is a form of static electricity.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-The wisemen pass their knowledge of life and nature onto the young so that they can understand the world, themselves and achieve great things.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>9/3/24</h4>
 
 <p>-I get the feeling that war is going to be used as a way to get a bunch of young guys who have no prospects, no house, no women or much of any place in society to fight. They've got nothing better to do and aren't in a stable place. They'll either be baited with the things they want or the lack of will be used to motivate them into war.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>10/3/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Spirituality is to understand the mind and mental or nervous system energies inside the body and world. Assumably this is electromagnetic. 
In the body this enhances the senses, ability to feel and ability to impose will and force. The mind, imagination, feeling and focus directs this energy.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Rituals in spirituality are a way to direct energy, attract or to work with nonphysical, energetic phenomena and or beings. 
You can skip the sillyness of a ritual once you understand what you're actually trying to do, then just do it.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-The weather is a lower, external spiritual phenomena.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Objects have a spiritual nature by their ability to interact electromagnetically. Electrostatics is one example, vibration is another.</p> 
 <br>
 <p>-Differentiate the lower spiritual which is air, gasses, smoke, etc from the higher spiritual which is light, energy, heat, etc.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Forget about drama or wordy troubles. Continue acquiring power.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Sound is air, taken in the by ear. Light is fire, taken in by the eye.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>11/3/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Smell is also taken in via the nose as an air.
Taste via water in the mouth, touch via skin, physical elements/earth.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>12/3/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Blimps or air balloon devices technically create anti weight so they are a form of airship.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>13/3/24</h4>
 
 <p>-The root, earth element numbs you so that you can face reality when you're in pain.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>14/3/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Human energy experiments with a voltmeter and power source.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>15/3/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Arcane knowledge is electrical knowledge.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-I think I accidentally activated a cars light with a radio frequency controller for one of my devices today.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-I was thinking that you could make a modulateable/programmable RF controller to mess with anything that runs on them. 
I guess that's what flipper zero is.
I'm interested in understanding more about how these controllers work. I remember 100 years ago, radio was super popular and they used it to control everything according to some old pictures and books.(Postnote – Look into ham radio.)</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Are you zeppelin pilled? with a couple bottles of hydrogen or a good electrolysis setup and some strong polymer balloons we can probably make our own airships. Of course they'll also need a frame, electronics, navigation, batteries, power generator, something to make it turnable/controllable. But I think it could become a simple to build basic airship, as long as you're comfortable with eating oats for weeks while you travel.</p>

 <p>This will be a crucial step until we figure out usable anti gravity and until batteries and panels make self made helicopters/jets more comfortable for long distance travel.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Maybe develop willpower. Crown power.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>16/3/24</h4>
 
 <p>-We have a 90 degree cone of good vision in front of us, then it extends to a 180 degree cone of peripheral or 90 peripheral, 90 frontal in a layered circle like cone shape.
If you turn your eyes you get another 90 towards that direction you look or you change your 180 degree cone 90 degrees, maybe less like 70 degrees.
Then if you turn your head you gain another 90. If you turn the body you get around 60-70.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Our vision is spherical or circular. VR looks like it. I imagine since VR is based off it.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-If you understand how Operating systems work and computers in general then you will be better at doing what you want with them.</p>
 
<p>Computers generally have a shell or a lower administration layer which is accessed via a terminal. You can access higher level commands which grants you access to do whatever you want through this terminal. Linux and Mac use a bash terminal for example which is its language.</p>
 
<p>The GUI or frontend you see is only a face. Go beyond it if you need to temporarily modify or access greater features.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-The two kinds of internal energies are tension and release/relaxation. Tension compresses and relaxation opens up and expands to allow for healing.</p>
 
<p>If you focus on parts of the body and will them to gently "release" or expand this helps you to heal. Internal organs that are injured by stress can be helped by this for example.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>18/3/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Creativity is hindered by stress. Usually people take drugs to be creative because it alleviates their work stress, financial stresses and whatever thoughts are weighing their mind and body down.</p>
 
<p>Having lots of free time lets you build up more flexibility and relaxation in order to then use that on hobbies and creative projects. 
Your sexual energy and vitality relates a lot to this.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-You can only control what you rule or own. Worrying too much about a country, company or group you don't control/rule isn't healthy long term. 
Either get to the top and rule it in order to impose your will or create your own to command.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Vibrating/pulsating water seems to create geometric, psychedelic like patterns/shapes very similar to the visuals on a DMT trip.</p>
<br>
 <p>-Apparently breathing techniques pressurize your veins. Try it out.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>19/3/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Learn to condense mental energy into a physical form. Electricity into a physical form.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Learn to do syscalls in c.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-What if the zoomers today are part alien hybrids which is why they're so weak. Then the vaccines would be related to that. A way to get more alien DNA or some kind of adjustments into them.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-The masses are farm animals or crops for the government.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Technology that can access your mind or subconscious, take images, sounds, smells, memories, etc from it and make movies or interactive game like experiences from it.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>20/3/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Worry comes from the stomach area, your middle to upper middle left side of the body. Release worry from there and focus around that area to strengthen the stomach to avoid worries.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Technology that responds to our thoughts and energy.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Many men want a fat wife but do not understand the price of feeding her.
To continue the joke, the price of a skinny wife is energy drinks and nicotine vapes. Still not cheap.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>21/3/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Face your worries.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Earth controls water, water controls fire, fire controls metal, metal controls wood, wood controls earth.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>23/3/24</h4>
 
 <p>-There is a disharmony between people who can make money with people who are skilled at what they do, knowledgeable, passionate or other needed qualities.</p>
 
<p>The ability to make money relates to your earth elements. Your passion relates to the fire. Wisdom is the water, depending on the element system.
So tldr, people who make money aren't always good at their job or business. They just know how to make money, more so than others.</p>
 
<p>Also, passion wont make you money, neither will skills or knowledge inherently. They'll help, but making money is making money.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Your organs are your internal magical centers. Like power orbs or crystals that each relate to different natural elements like water, earth, air and fire.
Strengthening them is called "internal training" while external training is enhancing the muscles and outer body.(Postnote – Sometimes core muscle training is referred to as inner training.)</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Squeezing gas produces heat, I think it can ignite that way too.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>24/3/24</h4>
 
 <p>-If you want to get good at something then do it every day.
A day or two a week is more of a maintenance routine.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-The main muscle of the penis really seems to be the inner penis or the perineal area.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>25/3/24</h4>
 
 <p>-There is internal and external tonifying. I think if you focus outside then your organs get drained, if you focus internally then your muscles and body gets drained.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-A major part of intelligence is noticing patterns. Cycles are just patterns. If something makes you feel a certain way when you eat it, that's a pattern, you now can remember it and know next time what will happen.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Learn how a combustion engine works.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-The veil of ignorance gets lifted the more you live and you start to realize more and more stuff, be able to sense more and more things. 
It is somewhat exhausting to adjust your life to it.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Most of the negatives about working is less about the work and more that you have to interact with society. Some people are just awful, awful beings that lack empathy.
If this part were improved or removed then work would be a lot less painful.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>26/3/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Doing deals with **** is a deal with the devil. "Sign your freedom and self away for fame and fortune", look at the music, porn and film industry. 
Maybe that's what it meant in the past, in a physical sense.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Certain things you can buy on a standard market like consumer products while raw materials or exotic things are more often found in industrial markets like al**aba. 
Just say you wanted to buy 1 ton of plastic, you wont find it on a regular market.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>27/3/24</h4>
 
 <p>-So first you secure survival, then finances, then material goods to do your work, then family, then travel, then creativity and intellectual pursuits then spirituality.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-I think when women take on trauma that they start to express it through their bodies as one way. Usually this means tattoos, short hair, piercings, dyed hair, short/slutty clothes. Sometimes they try to look masculine and "tough" in order to keep trauma away as well.
I see this like a form of decay or corruption, a fungus that slowly eats away at them.</p>
 <br>
 
 <h4>28/3/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Diversity hires and immigrants are destroying public services. I can't fucking stand interacting with society with how inefficient, poorly ran and low quality it’s becoming. 
Society is falling apart and will probably just be overtaken by robots who do their job right.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Build robots to do everything for you.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>29/3/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Sometimes you can tighten a stuck, rusted screw/bolt in order to unglue it, then you loosen it again.
It looks like oxides form in between the screw and the metal thread, probably from weathering, galvanic corrosion. Essentially natural electrolysis.</p>
 
<p>I grease any screws which could potentially suffer from this in order to avoid it.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-The issue of science is symbolic abstraction instead of physical description</p>
 <br>
 <h4>30/3/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Stoves are just a container, usually metal or ceramic, a heat source at the bottom like wood, coal, gas or electric and a top, grill or some way to hold and put stuff on the top of it. Then depending on the fuel they will have an exhaust at the back if they are big enough or used inside a room in order to pipe off the smoke/gasses outside or away from the user. They can also have legs or a base to control their height and avoid burning the floor.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>31/3/24</h4>
 
 <p>-“Planets show us what is happening
Signs show us how it is happening
Houses show us where it is happening” – Unknown source.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Maybe the veins and muscles are a kind of duality in the body. One is solid flesh and the other a hollow tube. One feeds another.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Mercury based chemicals used as drugs or exposure of them cause mild hallucinations and the ability to see strange etheric light. Perhaps psychedelics are related to or of the mercury element. 
Then the idea of the philosophers stone taking the alchemist outside of time and space, into an altered state sounds similar to a strong psychedelic drug trip.</p>
