 <h4>1/11/24</h4>
 
 <p>-I watched a crow, peck and fight with it's own reflection for minutes. Who knows how long it had been there for and will be there for.
It couldn't let it go and wasn't intelligence enough to realize it was just a reflection.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Young men are more eager in work but are clumsy. Young women are avoidant in work.</p>
  <br>
 <h4>2/11/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Birth control stops the monthly period and sexually sterilizes women which turns them into drone like beings for work/jobs.
It is heavily related to feminism which was to get women into the workplace.</p>
  <br>
 <p>-Richer areas don't have Radio wave towers in them.</p>
  <br>
 <p>-When you are exhausted, the whole body is fighting for blood.</p>
  <br>
 <p>-Astrologically the current suns house seems to be where blood and conscious attention flows to in the body.
We've entered Scorpio which is the lunar month to represent Halloween. No nut November is also placed here as Scorpio is related to the genitals and gonads in the body.</p>
  <br>
 <h4>3/11/24</h4>
 
 <p>-I think spikes of emotion like anger are from not expressing your emotions.</p>
  <br>
 <p>-When an adult is repressing their emotions, children seem to have tantrums which is an off gassing of the parents emotions.</p>
  <br>
 <h4>4/11/24</h4>
 
 <p>-The genitals allow you to fuck reality.</p>
  <br>
 <h4>5/11/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Temperature may have things to do with electromagnetism. Amperage and heat is a big one. Supposedly heat enlarges the magnetic field.</p>
  <br>
 <p>-Guys seem to magically get girlfriends sometime after working a job. I think the upgrade in status and money attracts women to them.</p>
  <br>
 <p>-Electronics seemingly can die like animals can.</p>
  <br>
 <h4>7/11/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Be at peace with yourself and what you do and you wont suffer from perfectionism or impostor syndrome.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-You could print circuits with copper 3d printed mesh. Maybe you can print components with the right metallic filaments.</p>
  <br>
 <h4>8/11/24</h4>
 
 <p>-The legs are the root of the body. Focus on them to remineralize and stabilize yourself.</p>
  <br>
 <p>-Men have an inherent desire to own women. Maybe women have a desire to be owned?
This will come out subconsciously through the ownership of sex robots in the future.
It already exists for women by being submissive to an overbearing government and corporations, in a negative sense.</p>
  <br>
 <p>-I wonder if we are creating our children by thinking of them. Creating a thought form to then instill into a body.</p>
  <br>
 <h4>9/11/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Working full time and being able to go to work while sick or feeling bad probably defines you as an adult.</p>
  <br>
 <p>-One day I'll pilot my own space ship made by me.</p>
  <br>
 <p>-Hell is a place on earth, a state that you are brought into if you fuck your life up.</p>
  <br>
 <p>-Illness is unnatural.</p>
  <br>
 <p>-It's strange that dinosaurs are such a common childrens toy. I imagine it is to normalize them.(Postnote – Look into the dinosaur conspiracy of them either not existing or being dragons.)</p>
  <br>
 <h4>10/11/24</h4>
 
 <p>-3D printing is so sci-fi, I love it. I think in the future that you'll be able to 3d print pretty much anything.</p>
  <br>
 <p>-Would be cool to "screen capture"/record your mind and be able to let others see it or put it into videos. I know I get some wild thoughts and mental experiences when out and about and am unable to write em down.</p>
  <br>
 <p>-Extreme tension seems to clear out the nerves and I imagine strengthen them. Practice tensing internally to improve this ability during meditation.</p>
  <br>
 <h4>11/11/24</h4>
 
 <p>-I think there might be unlimited energy in the earth that we can draw up. Assumably if you connected a coil to it to get it's resonant frequency and used the earth in an LC circuit. I think that's what Tesla was doing. Maybe those big Tesla coils could be powered by the earth through a resonant circuit.(Postnote – Or being a transformer between it and the skies energy.)</p>
  <br>
 <p>-Organic things seem to be by weight mostly just carbon and hydrogen or physical black matter and colorless water.
Maybe they're made up of carbohydrates.</p>
  <br>
 <p>-Resonator circuit with the earth. Drawing up the negative or positive energy like a capacitor through resonation.</p>
  <br>
 <h4>12/11/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Darkness, wetness seem to cause a form of fermentation and rotting in things. It replenishes dried out infertile soil for example and allows growth within it.</p>
  <br>
 <p>-Cleaning and organizing things feels like leveling up.</p>
  <br>
 <p>-Reverse breathing reverses the course of nature. So instead of aging and growing older you'd grow in reverse? 
This would instead of forming the physical body, reverse it into spiritual energy.</p>
  <br>
 <h4>13/11/24</h4>
 
 <p>-When cleaning and throwing stuff out. Put things into two piles, one wanted and another maybe not. For the second pile, look at each item again and split it up into items you want to keep and not. 
This helps I find.</p>
  <br>
 <h4>14/11/24</h4>
 
 <p>-So 3D printed reeds work.</p>
  <br>
 <h4>15/11/24</h4>
 
 <p>-3D printing is the manufacturing equivalent of generative and text AI.</p>
  <br>
 <p>-Look more into how they get the organic ingredients for plastics.</p>
  <br>
 <p>-Early and mid 2000's Japan is technologically interesting because of their I-Mode internet phone. It seems like they advanced so much because of early adoption of this technology that put the internet which is text and video communication in so many peoples hands.</p>
  <br>
 <p>-Maybe the clock frequency of a pc could be used to do occultic things like summon spirits, create portals, etc. With an antenna maybe.</p>
  <br>
 <p>-The structure of all physical objects is based on how they are organized.</p>
  <br>
 <h4>17/11/24</h4>
 
 <p>-All physical things are shape and color. Geometry is their form and colors are their pigments.</p>
  <br>
 <h4>18/11/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Instrument tones
Baritone(Deepest), Tenor(Deep to middle), Alto(Middle to high), Soprano(High pitch).</p>
  <br>
 <p>-Maybe on a universal frequency list, sound is the first thing above the horizon line, then if you densify stuff it turns into water and then physical matter.</p>
  <br>
 <p>-A chair is alive because it has a magnetic field. Objects have some kind of energy field, which gives them a form of life.</p>
  <br>
 <p>-When sugar is burnt it caramelizes, plasticizes and then turns to a black syrup and then carbon. Organs and flesh do this too. Plastic reminds me of it.</p>
  <br>
 <p>-Crude oil seems to be like a primordial soup of life.</p>
  <br>
 <h4>19/11/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Amperage is symbolized by I.</p>
  <br>
 <p>-Air is weird as. Try blowing on your hand. Where does this stuff even come from? What is it? What can it be used for? These are some questions to think over.</p>
  <br>
 <h4>20/11/24</h4>
 
 <p>-General purpose robot design.</p>
 
<p>Major functions are the physical movement functions and the mental thinking functions followed by sensors(nerve sensors, touch sensors, eyes, ears, air, etc.). </p>
 
<p>Batteries, power inverters and power regulators, power cables are very important. A heart or emotional processor/actuator is a semi important function. Water and air storage and releasing are semi important. </p>
 
<p>Other functions might be oscilloscope, USB power, socket power, internal storage(fluids, gas, power, physical objects), sexual functions, vibration functions.</p>
  <br>
 <p>-Electret.</p>
  <br>
 <p>-Static field detector.</p>
  <br>
 <p>-I wonder if there are any natural electret rocks or materials.</p>
  <br>
 <p>-I think Australians abused their root energy and now are suffering greatly in this sphere of life and energy. They are so impatient and possessed by materialism.</p>
  <br>
 <h4>22/11/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Opening the nerves lets you see a similar blockage in the veins and rest of the body. So opening the nerves lets you feel that area then opening the physical body lets it heal or form maybe.</p>
  <br>
 <p>-Severe injuries to the body can cause nerve and spinal damage. This stops you from having easy control of that region of the physical body and it starts to decay or not heal as well.
Prolonged focus on the injured area of the spine can seemingly start to heal it. This wont yet heal the physical body but get you access to it like opening a door. Then you can focus on the injured physical areas, usually the circulation channels will be weak, they are good to focus on first.</p>
  <br>
 <p>-Material or what it's made from and form/body, the shape of the thing. These are the two fundamentals of material objects. How it was made, the natural processes, temperatures, ingredients and such can all influence the material. The shape is then how it is adjusted.</p>
 
<p>Density is an inherent quality of material. I guess density also dictates form too. Weave or pattern is another prime quality. Made from material, that made from materials original state. Manufacture process.</p>
  <br>
 <h4>23/11/24</h4>
 
 <p>-I wonder if some alien abduction dreams are traumatic memories of childhood medical surgeries and medical experiences.
Being on a white table surrounded by foreign beings, getting prodded and tested on.</p>
  <br>
 <p>-Spinning a fan one side pulls air and the other way pushes air. Or makes it go forwards/backwards.</p>
  <br>
 <p>-Adding weight to a motor makes it draw more amperage.</p>
  <br>
 <h4>24/11/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Gears, chains and belts move physical or kinetic energy while propellers, and impellers move spiritual/air energy.</p>
  <br>
 <p>-The older you grow, the less you get controlled by feelings and thoughts.</p>
  <br>
 <p>-High torque motors are important for gear stuff.</p>
  <br>
 <p>-Spinning wheels seem to have a pull towards a certain area. Almost like an anti gravity effect.</p>
  <br>
 <h4>25/11/24</h4>
 
 <p>-I'm playing with animation and when it renders it does it in individual images per frame. I guess that's how video works electronically, just a bunch of images played one another the other. I feel like I've been lied to.</p>
  <br>
 <p>-Use smoke or mist to test aerodynamics.</p>
  <br>
 <h4>26/11/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Increasing frequency can increase motor speed for AC motors.</p>
  <br>
 <p>-I don't get why car manufacturers don't rerelease their old 90's and early 2000's era body sportscars but with modern advancements.</p>
  <br>
 <p>-Australia might be a money printer country. Exporting crap to sell to them might be very lucrative.</p>
  <br>
 <h4>27/11/24</h4>
 
 <p>-I don't even see the mercury retrograde as a time where technological things go wrong but just a time to peer even deeper into engineering and technology, to learn how it all works and master the physics of the world.
Of course, do be careful with your decisions for it though.</p>
  <br>
 <h4>28/11/24</h4>
 
 <p>-If the currency continues to inflate but fast food companies keep releasing seasonal cheap deals then we could say that the true backing of the currency is cheap pizza or fried chicken. I guess it almost acts as a deflationary force.</p> 
  <br>
 <p>-Hospital births shouldn't be normal in my opinion. We spent all of history doing it ourselves, so spending thousands to get your new baby manhandled by ethnics isn't a great investment.</p>
  <br>
 <p>-Difficulty in life, stress, work, hard experience, training and such builds up a "negative charge" in you. This charge feels like ambient pain, discomfort and heaviness in the body.</p>
 
<p>Drugs, sugar, fun, cumming, and other releases, even speaking can release this charge and give you a "positive charge". The positive charge is light in weight, makes you creative, hollows out your body and stimulates.</p>
 
<p>Now the balance is that if you wash out your negative charge with too much positive, you ruin your health and become ungrounded. Poverty and physical weakness can come from this. But an excess negative charge makes you stressed, gives you health issues, makes you dislike being around others and makes you nihilistic.</p>
 
<p>So living like a brown bread, early morning waking peasant makes you more stable and slowly gains riches but you become miserable and living chaotically is fun and exciting and makes you more spiritual and creative but your body gets weak and everything around you starts to collapse and loose any stability and value in it.</p>
  <br>
 <h4>29/11/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Having an inner and outer plastic shell seems to add to strength.
Lots of plastic layers. Maybe with soft layers too.(Postnote – I looked into old phone designs to understand why they were so tough.)</p>
  <br>
 <p>-The energy of will and focus is mental energy. It seems to store around the back of the head in the cerebellum region. The middle or front seems to handle "mental power". If you use your will and force something it is using the mind, its power and energy stored. This is magic in a sense. So the back stores and the middle or front is the prime mover/forcer.</p>
 
<p>When performing meditations, you use the mind and its power. Too much of this will exhaust your mental energy and make your head sore, like an overused muscle. The kidneys can also be drained too.</p>
 
<p>Mental pressure can be trained by holding tension in the inner head where it originates. Feel when applying mental pressure by focusing on your hand strongly and sense where in the head is being used to apply this pressure.
Mental energy can be stored and the storage capacity enhanced by extended focus on the storage area in the head around the cerebellum region.</p>
  <br>
 <p>-A desire for death is weak root life force.</p>
  <br>
 <p>-Perhaps avoiding of life and trying to escape life are to escape the root, the source of life.</p>
  <br>
 <h4>30/11/24</h4>
 
 <p>-I've been thinking about the major and minor repairs of a car and motorcycle. Minor are pretty much what you'll need to do if you buy a used one, and for really bad, unrepaired ones, the major category would apply.</p>
 
<p>I've avoided big engine repair related stuff besides transmission. The price of a lot of this also depends if you do it yourself. Some repairs are difficult like replacing the lower end of your engine, which is why it'll cost a ton to get done, while the actual physical part (gears) isn't that expensive.</p>
 
<p>Minor - Battery(expensive), oil(cheap), coolant(cheap), brake pads,(cheap) brake fluid(cheap), tyres(expensive), spark plugs(cheap).</p>
 
<p>Major - Clutch, chain, rims, brake rotor and caliper, cables and tubes, gears, electric motors, aircon parts, radio.</p>
