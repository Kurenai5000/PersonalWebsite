 <h4>3/12/24</h4>
 
 <p>-When making pegs and holes in 3d printing, the hole or negative space is usually going to print smaller than designed. So you can make your pegs something like 6mm and your hole 6.5mm Usually that gets a tight fit. 
Larger holes in the cm range can be the same though if you're willing to hammer them in.
Otherwise sandpaper and grease helps it to fit.</p>
  <br>
 <p>-Most of our engines seem to use spiritual forces to power them. 
Air pressure pushes a piston in the piston motor. The air and fuel compresses and explodes with a spark, propelling pressure out and driving the piston head, then this moves the drive train.</p>
 
<p>Magnetism is the driving force of an electromagnetic motor as this pushes and pulls the rotator. Electricity simply creates a magnetic field via coils, alternating for AC. Electrostatic energy can be used to power electrostatic motors which are uncommon.</p>
 
<p>Turbines can be moved via common wind or rivers or physical objects and force. Usually these are connected to an electric motor to generate power. So water or physical matter can push and apply a force to the turbine. Hand crank generators are one form of physical motors for example.</p>
 
<p>But otherwise, this should illustrate the point that most motors used commonly are powered by non physical, spiritual forces like air, steam, pressure and electromagnetism.</p>
  <br>
 <p>-Life doesn't start until you develop your root. This gives you freedom to choose your own life, personal power. Free will and the ability to stand up to fear.</p>
  <br>
 <h4>4/12/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Judging by smell, fertilizers are the urinary, excretory and sexual essences of animals. Bones as well. Plant based ones can be used too I imagine in the form of ash, charcoal or wood mulch.</p>
  <br>
 <h4>5/12/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Leg nerves - femoral, sciatic, and tibial nerves.</p>
<p>Arm nerves - radial, median, and ulnar nerves.</p>
  <br>
 <h4>8/12/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Occultism of Christmas - Christmas is the Winter solstice holiday and Santa Claus is Saturn(Reaper, Satan, god of earth, time and matter). There is a strong emphasis on materialism or gifts as Saturn rules this. 
I believe that the Christmas tree(pine tree) decorated with lights is symbolic of the stars. The top is the north star. 
During new moon phases and the depths of winter, the body focuses its energies down into the bowels and inner sexual organs as well as bones. This festival time seems like a rising of that energy.</p>
  <br>
 
 <h4>9/12/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Energy is cycling through time, momentum is cycling through space.</p>
  <br>
 <p>-Robots that handle all house chores like clothes washing, dish cleaning, mowing, vacuuming, house cleaning,</p>
  <br>
 <h4>10/12/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Don't ignore your problems or else they'll grow like the grass that's uncut.</p>
  <br>
 <p>-This year had a huge engineering and electronics vibe to it, I wonder what next year will bring.</p>
  <br>
 <p>-I wonder if blood could be refined further or made into some kind of philosophers stone.
It is a weird substance that can be a liquid or solid and seems to crystallize when dry.</p>
  <br>
 <p>-One method of healing is to generate flesh. Restoring vital force might be generating blood and blood energy in the body.</p>
  <br>
 <h4>11/12/24</h4>
 
 <p>-To develop your Martian(Strength) and Saturnian(Stability) side are needed characteristics of a man in harsh places. Mercury(Intelligence) comes later.</p>
  <br>
 <p>-I hope the age of SUV cars ends. Every car I see is either a SUV or SUV truck.</p>
  <br>
 <h4>12/12/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Learn to build Tesla coils.</p>
  <br>
 <p>-Layered heatsink like shape for 3d prints.</p>
  <br>
 <h4>13/12/24</h4>
 
 <p>-I think when I did stimulants(Coffee, cigarettes) and ate spicy food that I had a lot more creativity and spiritual energy while now I've lost a lot of it because I'm always grounding.</p>
  <br>
 <h4>14/12/24</h4>
 
 <p>-I'm noticing that the races that work together and have strong family structures are winning this era. Most of these races aren't even that smart or practical. It's the same way that the people who work as a group usually manage to beat a single person who might be better than them. 
I think we're going to have to strengthen our own familial structures and bonds in order to win.</p>
  <br>
 <p>-Pain wise, getting zapped and burnt feels the same.
Electricity seems like super fire in a way, at least electrostatic.</p>
  <br>
 <p>-Air expands when heated. I guess this is how a hot air balloon works.</p>
  <br>
 <h4>15/12/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Understanding power and torque bands for engines is important. Usually the upper 40-30% before redline is that region. If you stay there, you get the most power. They're easier to hit with smaller engines. Using larger or high performance engines on the street means you'll have to use lower gears to hit them.</p>
  <br>
 <p>-Cabling for cars and motorcycles seems to just be "connect the cable and connector". It's simple but there's lots of them and they all plug into sensors or other parts making it complex.</p>
  <br>
 <p>-Temperature gauge, fuel gauge, oil pressure gauge, tachometer, speedometer.</p>
  <br>
 <p>-I felt electrostatic energy from the air near someones fingers or the straw that they were trying hard to balance on a cup when I put my hand close to grab it.</p>
  <br>
 <h4>16/12/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Force = pressure * area.</p>
  <br>
 <p>-Turns out trying to keep to torque specs on smaller bolts isn't really so good. You risk threading them too easily. Better to feel it out.</p>
  <br>
 <p>-Teflon tape can save some threaded screws.</p>
  <br>
 <p>-Alchemists saw the salt of metals as a poison and instead distilled off the oils and spiritual liquids from them. Perhaps the salt is the most medicinal, strongest part, simply that it's just too strong.
So then, assumably the acetates are good enough. Though maybe if you refine it further with heat or something that it could mature and refine it into a better substance.</p>
  <br>
 <p>-I think when things are heated beyond a certain point they denature. This means that they no longer have a unique balance of the three prime substances of salt, oil and liquids.
Denatured substances cannot transform and grow like living, organic things can.
Perhaps denatured substances need to ferment and rot in order to become raw material in order to become living matter again.</p>
  <br>
 <h4>17/12/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Plastic metal hybrid materials to combine electrostatic and magnetic bearing capabilities.</p>
  <br>
 <p>-Teflon mixed with wool or organics to combine electrostatically positive and negative material.</p>
  <br>
 <p>-Bent over reverse dumbbell flies are great for the back. Lower or close to the body hits the lower sides more while upper/raised arm or away from the body gets the shoulders more.</p>
 
<p>The motion is similar to flies on your back but you do them bent over like in a row position.</p>
  <br>
 <p>-Apply raw metaphysics, occultic understandings of reality to all things, apply it to the material work to create occultic technology.</p>
  <br>
 <p>-Perhaps holding in breath and continuously breathing as in some techniques causes heat from compression of air.</p>
  <br>
 <p>-Spiritual techniques working with the breath and heart are more old school like combustion engines while ones working with the brain/mind are more electromagnetic.
So these are the two main spiritual energies.</p>
  <br>
 <h4>18/12/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Things happen because you do stuff. If you don't do stuff, things don't happen.</p>
  <br>
 <p>-I hypothesize that organic mineral crystals or even other ones might become oily from heat. Heat and adding more alcohol maybe. So cook or caramelizing them.</p>
  <br>
 <h4>19/12/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Perhaps magically purifying the brain of someone intoxicated could sober them up.</p>
  <br>
 <p>-"There are several main parts of speech in the English language, each serving a specific purpose in conveying meaning and structure in a sentence. Here are some of the most common types:</p>
 <p>Nouns: Words that represent a person, place, thing, or idea. Examples: "cat," "tree," "Paris," "happiness."</p>
 <p>Pronouns: Words that replace or refer to nouns, helping to avoid repetition and clarify meaning. Examples: "he," "she," "it," "they," "them," "this," "that."</p>
 <p>Verbs: Words that describe an action, occurrence, or state of being. Examples: "run," "jump," "hold," "be," "become," "seem."</p>
 <p>Adjectives: Words that describe or modify a noun or pronoun. Examples: "red," "happy," "tall," "bright," "smart."</p>
 <p>Adverbs: Words that describe or modify a verb, adjective, or another adverb. Examples: "quickly," "very," "really," "almost," "happily."</p>
 <p>Prepositions: Words that show the relationship between a noun or pronoun and another word in the sentence. Examples: "in," "on," "at," "with," "without," "under," "over."</p>
 <p>Conjunctions: Words that join two or more words, phrases, or clauses together. Examples: "and," "but," "or," "yet," "so," "for," "nor."</p>
 <p>Interjections: Words or short phrases that express strong emotions or sudden feelings, often used independently of the grammatical structure of a sentence. Examples: "oh," "ouch," "wow," "hurray," "ouch."</p>
 <p>These are the primary parts of speech in the English language, and understanding and using them correctly is essential for effective communication and writing." -GabAI</p>
 <br>
 <h4>20/12/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Metals and parts of the body - </p>
<p>Silver - Brain/mind.</p>
<p>Mercury - Throat and lungs.</p>
<p>Lead - Bowels.</p>
<p>Copper – Bladder/heart.</p>
<p>Tin - Genitals.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-There is thermal and non thermal plasma or cold plasma.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Learning to analyse language hasn't made me a better writer or speaker, it is interesting to learn how to do it though. 
Instead what improves your ability to describe is to hone in more with your words on what you are really trying to describe.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-First strengthen the body, then circulate energy through the body. Then build the base, then gather the elixir.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-"Basic Cultivation Stages
These stages focus on building and refining the foundational life energy (qi).</p>
 
 <p>Body Refining / Tempering (锻体 / 炼体, Duan Ti / Lian Ti)
 Strengthening the physical body to withstand qi and cultivate energy.
Involves purifying the body, removing impurities, and enhancing physical strength.

<p>Qi Refining / Gathering (炼气, Lian Qi)
 The first stage of harnessing and refining qi within the body.
Practitioners learn to circulate qi through their meridians (energy channels).</p>

<p>Foundation Establishment (筑基, Zhu Ji)
Solidifying the internal foundation for higher cultivation.
Stabilizing qi flow and preparing for advanced spiritual growth.
Core Formation Stages
These stages introduce significant transformations within the practitioner.</p>
 
 <p>Golden Core / Jindan Formation (结丹 / 金丹, Jie Dan / Jindan)
 The practitioner condenses their qi into a tangible, spiritual "core" or "elixir" in their dantian (energy center).
This stage represents a leap in power and spiritual maturity.</p>

<p>Nascent Soul (元婴, Yuan Ying)
 The Golden Core evolves into a "Nascent Soul," a miniature spiritual version of the practitioner.
At this stage, the soul becomes more independent and capable of leaving the body temporarily.</p>

<p>Soul Formation / Spirit Severing (化神 / 分神, Hua Shen / Fen Shen)
Advanced spiritual cultivation, where the practitioner gains deeper mastery of the soul and spirit.
Often involves severing attachments to the mortal world and preparing for transcendence.</p>

<p>Immortal Stages
These stages focus on breaking free from mortality and ascending to higher realms.</p>
 
 <p>Void Refining (炼虚, Lian Xu)
A stage of merging the soul with the void, transcending physical limitations.
Often tied to understanding universal laws or "Dao" (the Way).

<p>Tribulation Transcendence (渡劫, Du Jie)
Facing heavenly tribulations (lightning storms or cosmic tests) to prove worthiness of immortality.
Surviving this stage allows practitioners to shed their mortal coils.</p>

<p>Ascension (飞升, Fei Sheng)
Successfully ascending to the Immortal Realm, leaving the mortal world behind.
Practitioners become true Immortals (Xian, 仙).</p>

<p>Post-Immortal Stages (Optional in Some Stories)
These stages describe progress after becoming an Immortal.</p>
 
 <p>True Immortal (真仙, Zhen Xian)
Basic Immortal status with enhanced longevity and power.</p>

<p>Golden Immortal (金仙, Jin Xian)
Mastery of laws of the universe and greater control over reality.</p>

<p>Great Dao Immortal / Dao Ancestor (道祖, Dao Zu)
Near god-like beings who fully comprehend and embody the Dao."
ChatGPT (Postnote – This is from Wuxia but it is taken from daoism.)</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Lighting seems to be related to fertility because wherever it his, plants become very fertile in that area.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>21/12/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Copper seems to stimulate the heart.</p>
<p>Magnesium - bladder, negative, pulls down.</p>
<p>Silicon - lead like, very negative, bowels.</p>
<p>Iron - top of head.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>22/12/24</h4>
 
 <p>-The left side circulates. When you lay on the left side it circulates through the body. When on the right side, life force coagulates internally.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>23/12/24</h4>
 
 <p>-The epub format seems jank at first because it can suffer from poor editing and incorrect text size(change it in your reader). But it's a superior format to pdf if done correctly. Computer books don't need pages since they can infinitely scroll. Hence we should take advantage of this format.</p>
 
<p>Pages on the web are fine as they segment, categorize and allow for "left and right" functionality in a way. 
If you need to write something short and want to make it a picture or couple pictures, this is also fine I think. Though for long sections of text like a full book, epub is better as you can scroll without breaks.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-It is the job of the grounded person to guide the ungrounded person into the world the same way it is the job of the ungrounded person to guide the grounded one into wisdom and knowledge.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-I'm looking at videos of new humanoid robots and they're being shown off in how they can replace worker jobs for companies. While automation is an inevitability which shouldn't be fought against, it's kind of lame how we have both AI and robots, the mind and body of a human in mechanical and computerized form but it is entirely crafted for corporate use(To make money). I'm not anti capitalism but shouldn't think it is the only focus of life.</p>
 
<p>I have more respect for the gooners who use this hyper tech to wank with because at least they have some creativity. 
Personally I primarily use it to learn. But reducing one of the coolest sci-fi technologies to just a tool of customer service shows we are in a very lame phase. One day we'll get teleportation or hyper speed travel and it'll just be used to transport goods at this rate.</p>
 
<p>I think AI and robotics will bring on the final phase of the capitalistic-corporatism society that we're in. When immigration gets replaced by robots and then regular peoples jobs get taken over by AI, then society will get heavily shaken up. Our values will have to change and the way we live our lives too.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Lakhovsky coil looks like an ac driver connected to a tesla coil, connected to an interesting coil shape antenna that projects out radio waves from around 1hz to 300ghz. Supposedly this radio frequency energy is healing. 
It looks like a non modulateable rife machine. This one seems to have a full spectrum of RF compared to picking individual frequencies.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-By the looks of it a tesla coil is just a high freq oscillating/AC, thick wire primary coil with a smaller wire secondary coil inside of it. So it's like a HF transformer. You're just converting low voltage ac to high voltage ac through the transforming of the coils.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Strong positively orientated drugs, or yang drugs would cause sweating, purifying, strong blood and energy circulation and start healing the physical body.
Strong negative or yin drugs would pull the bodies resources in and consolidate it within the body, densifying the bones, building flesh.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-There are passive and active smells. Passive smells are bacterial in nature. An object, ambiently sitting there, giving off a smell due to bacteria transforming the object into its smell like an orange fruit or animal smells.
Active smells are from agitation of things. Crushing, cutting, grinding, heating, boiling, etc. Making coffee or cutting grass would be some examples. (Postnote – I guess it’s a question of bacteria or volatile/essential oil.)</p>
 <br>
 <h4>24/12/24</h4>
 
 <p>-The upper arms and shoulder are the storage and strength region for the arms while the butt and upper leg are that for the leg.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Your throat, the mercury center lets you process words. Your mind, the lunar center lets you process what is within the words.</p>
<br>
 <p>-You should be able to use the exit hole of an impeller blower to use as a sucker.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-I think things make sound when they vibrate/oscillate.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-The core seems the most important part of the body muscle wise.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>25/12/24</h4>
 
 <p>-When near someone who was very frightened and crying. I could sense their disrupted, chaotic energy. I tried to help them calm down and it was like relaxing a storm.
I could tangibly feel their chaotic field of energy and was able to focus on it and ground it, relax it for some time. </p>
 
 <p>I was heavily distracted at this time and wasn't able to properly put much force or will into it. Though, the point being is that I think we can learn to control others emotions through energetic means. Similar to energy healing through focusing someones bodies energy, feel and smoothing that out. 
Their emotional fields can be controlled as well.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Trauma seems to force you into the central channel of the organs. This puts you "outside of your body" or technically inside.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-I imagine a thicker wire with more amperage would be more magnetic while a thin wire coil with lots of windings would be higher voltage and less magnetic.
Because each winding carries electrostatic energy, capacitance forms the inductance of the coil I think.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-With electric engines, aircraft can go higher up in the sky since it's engine wont need air for combustion, only to cool it.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>26/12/24</h4>
 
 <p>-The whole of the Capricorn lunar month usually feels pretty dry and grounded. "Souless" is one way to look at it as usually there isn't any cheap entertainment or fun to it.
It's a good time to rest and re-evaluate things, think up plans, check your own status. Debt is usually acquired in this time too.
You must endure boredom.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-I wonder if pain in the body stimulates growth hormones.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Society feels like It's constantly getting heavier, denser. This is why everything is becoming more expensive.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>27/12/24</h4>
 
 <p>-I saw an orange fluffy cat today. It walked beside me and did a couple of rolls on the ground. 
What wonderful creatures.</p>
 <br>
 
 
 <h4>28/12/24</h4>
 
 <p>-I wonder if Asia represents the right side of the body, the liver while Europe represents the stomach, the left side of the body.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-A country that prioritizes money above race and community will only get money in the short term. It'll loose the race that built it up to this point.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>29/12/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Trauma seems to be stored in the organs as an excess that didn't get processed. 
If you focus on the organ or somehow manage to remember the trauma, that organ starts to be stimulated, giving you memories of it. Breathing would take you to the lungs, eating to the stomach, etc.
Focus on the organ which didn't get to process in order to release the trauma. You will have to remember and experience bad times and memories though so the body waits until you are ready.</p>

 <p>-Divination interactive web page
https://kurenai5000.github.io/PersonalWebsite/html/Fun/divination.html</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Figuring out how to make polymer fabrics as soft and comfortable as natural ones and also having the same electrostatic/galvanic series properties is important.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Powering motors with vacuum pressure. Maybe using water.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-When you continuously fail you are not yet enough, not strong enough, smart enough, rich enough, etc. 
You need to level up and level your tools or gear up too. Improve your techniques and strategies, wait for a better time.
Eventually you will overcome it and go to the next level.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Maybe the more intensely you focus and more energy you put into a mental image, the more real it becomes.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>30/12/24</h4>
 
 <p>-If you wanna be an artist or do some kind of risky career, you need to ask yourself if your work is really good enough to throw away everything to do it.
Will you actually succeed? If the answer is no, then don't do it. Do your art on the side. 
I threw away my life for my art and failed. I wasn't good enough. I learned things the hard way.</p>
