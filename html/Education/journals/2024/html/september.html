 <h4>1/9/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Wearing magnets would help people with negative energy deficiencies who need more grounding and coolness.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Direct the energy into the bones and muscles, the internal organs to strengthen them.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Heavy wind makes it hard to relax.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>2/9/24</h4>

 <p>-As a man, men seem to respect you when you're physically strong/big and women do when your status/job is higher up.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-A king can do whatever he wants because the land is all his, the people are all his, the resources too.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Australians are too stuck in their base nature, greed and anger.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>3/9/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Programs just seems to be ways of controlling the pc, a script, like a magic script. You can use the terminal to do something similar.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>6/9/24</h4>
 
 <p>-I think people get stuck in life partially because they are internally stuck. There's a fear or resistance to change, to push forward or improve something.
It's like the anxiety or blocked feeling you get when starting a big project, the feeling of being overwhelmed. If you can conquer it mentally and emotionally then you can start it physically and move from there.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-When you get to the peak of something it's hard to move onto the next thing, it feels sometimes like a downgrade until you get used to it.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>9/9/24</h4>
 
 <p>-"Gravity" is probably just an effect of being in a charged/electrostatic field.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-The Sahara desert is the naval chakra. The rainforest is the bladder chakra. South Africa and Australia are the root. Mediterranean is the heart. North Europe is the mind and northern Hyperborea is the crown.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>10/9/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Life always seems to throw the hardest things at you when you're new at something, when unprepared and weak. Then when you get experience it's like the weather changes, it doesn't just get easier from the experience but things really move or change around you too.
If you can understand this and not get exhausted, traumatized or depressed from hard experiences when new, then you can overcome and conquer.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>11/9/24</h4>
 
 <p>-An old school TV is like an old radio. It's a screen with an antenna and tuning device to tune into different frequencies.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Creativity and libido are linked. The loss of libido brings the loss of creativity.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>12/9/24</h4>
 
 <p>-I'm starting to wonder if certain countries, regions or continents are like containment zones for certain races of people. The same way that crude oil is usually underground and you wouldn't want to touch it with your hands.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>13/9/24</h4>
 
 <p>-I'm starting to see people as archetypes, forgetting them but seeing each archetype as the same person.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>16/9/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Algorithms - Search algorithms(Binary(Sorted list search), Depth-First search(Searches down tree nodes), Breadth-first search(Wider search), sort algorithms(Insertion sort(larger), Merge sort(Smaller), Quick sort), Hreedy algorithm.</p>
 
<p>Data structures - Array, Linked list, Hashmap(quick searching), Stacks, Queue, Tree, Graphs,</p>
 <br>
 <p>-I found out that these programming quiz site questions are all about data structures and algorithms. That's cause programming job interviews ask questions on them or recycle these questions.
I had just been programming without knowing these things for years.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Supposedly crystals can oscillate at certain frequencies.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>17/9/24</h4>
 
 <p>-An elixir of immortality would be a kidney strengthening elixir probably.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>18/9/24</h4>
 
 <p>-I think playing games with someone, making them have fun and bringing them out of misery can be a strong positive force in their life.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-I guess emotions relate to the heart cause it's when you start dealing with people. So to control emotions would help you work with people.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-The highest state is that of a child, to be able to play without anything holding you back.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-If we can figure out what causes weather effects then we can create lightning, condense water from the air and create wind the same way that we can create heat, light and electromagnetic phenomena from electrical technology.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-When gas is heated it becomes expanded/larger. When cooled it condenses and shrinks, eventually into a liquid.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>19/9/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Plastic is like a solid water, a solid gel.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>21/9/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Being in a high place puts you into your heart. If you have a weak heart/chest then you'll probably have issues there.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-The road where you drive is the second layer of hell.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-When water is heated it becomes spiritual. When frozen it becomes physical. When something is heated it spiritualises and cooled it condenses and become solid. This is the basics of alchemical refinement.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Perhaps I've sold parts of myself for wisdom. I can't deny, it was a good trade.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>22/9/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Being up in the sky or higher up like a roof puts you into your chest and heart area of the body. If you have issues with the heart or lungs I think it gives you a "fear of heights" or a sick feeling. Perhaps then being at sea puts you into the bladder and pelvic area of the body. People who get sea sickness might have issues in these areas and organs.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-You can psychically contact people by focusing on them. The emotions you get after doing that is what they think back to you. Be it good or bad.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-NO3 chemicals dissolve or are subtle salts/volatile.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>23/09/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Gravity is probably the effect of the earths electrostatic field.
The sky is positive and earth is negative.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Maybe the older I get, the more I'll want to read books.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>24/09/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Don't use hidden language in alchemy.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Three major areas. The Americas of south and north. Asia with Asia minor being Australia. Then Europe and Africa as the southern area of Europe. These three almost form a triangle. Asia being right of Europe and America being Right of Asias. Russia sits on top of Asia so it acts almost like north Asia or Asian Europe.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-When connecting electrical cables to salt water infused litmus paper. One becomes acidic and the other alkaline.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>25/09/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Perhaps the electrochemistry is to separate the two substances into their salt and solvent. Then mixing them creates the salt?</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Platinum electrodes or ones that don't break easily, electrolyze plant juices to try separate them alchemically.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Levels or hierarchy of life.</p>
<p>1. Survival, housing, food and drink..</p>
<p>2. Pleasure, rest, healing..</p>
<p>3. Ego, status, money, business, possessions..</p>
<p>4. Family, friends, connection, social..</p>
<p>5. Education, reading/writing, travel, exploration..</p>
<p>6. Science, art, engineering, creativity, creation..</p>
<p>7. Spirituality, peace, freedom.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Connecting with other people is at the middle. Nonphysical, mental, spiritual, intellectual things are at the top and physical, survival things are at the bottom.</p>
 
<p>The bottom helps to allow for the middle and top. Sometimes the top can help the bottom as better knowledge of farming would allow for more food production. Though usually things happen from the bottom up. 
This means that it will be hard to do business and make money if you are homeless or to get a family or be creative if you are poor.</p>
 
<p>Mens most important level is 3, money, business, ego. Womens I believe is 4, family and connections. That is mostly how men and women get what they want, are satisfied and survive.</p>
 <br>
 
 <p>-Stuff that is more noble or positive on the galvanic series supposedly is more corrosion resistive.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Candy is very archetypal. Having flavors related to colors is an interesting thing.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>27/09/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Bread is analogous to the four element and nature. The bottom part is the most hard and dense, earth element. The top crust is the most crunchy, the fire element. Inside is the realm of air and water which is the soft dough, the bottom being more dense which is the water and the upper area having more air in it.</p>
<br>
 <h4>29/9/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Practice writing. Words are just a record of thoughts. So practice thinking and writing.</p>
