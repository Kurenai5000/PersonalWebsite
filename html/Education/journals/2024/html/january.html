 <h4>1/1/24</h4>

 <p>-If you view the world through your own eyes and feel it through your own body then you should see yourself as the greatest and most important. 
Not out of narcissism or delusion, but because you are you, not someone else and others wont do the work for you, they wont live for you or help you.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Qi functionally is controlled by focus, so learn to make your focus into pressure, heat, light, fire or something else to do magic.</p>
<br>
 <h4>2/1/24</h4>
 
 <p>-A man is a tool that's function is to produce resources/money, at least in the eyes of society.</p>
 <br>
  <p>-We all have a background, it is our life when young and then when mostly developed. Some people have a military background, school background,     country life backgrounds, etc.
This gives you certain skills in your societal or worldly life that others may not have, it makes you unique.</p>
 <br>
  <p>-The world only exists because of separation, opposites.
If everything were all one then it'd be nothing.</p>
 <br>
  <p>-I've never been annoyed that I saved money, but I have that I spent it.</p>
 <br>
  <p>-I assume a ph neutral metallic medicine is the least poisonous to the body. So a carbonate might be good or an acetate.</p>
 <br>
  <p>-When mixing the copper hydroxide(assumably) with vinegar it formed a blue liquid. I believe this is an acid/base reaction where the hydroxide is the base. 
Either way, this experiment has shown that electrolysis using salts and bases seems to yield an ash/ceramic substance, while in acids yields an essence or dissolved substance.</p>
 <br>
  <p>-You can turn a hydroxide into an oxide by calcining it apparently.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>3/1/24</h4>
 
  <p>-Maybe as young people we start of in the mind and then slowly reach the root of the spine when old. This is why we become old and crusty, stuck in our ways. 
So to gain neuroplasticity would be to stimulate the brain. This is what spiritual cultivators do, they take the path back to the brain and become childlike.</p>
 <br>
  <p>-If you scaled up electrostatic levitation then perhaps you could levitate big objects.</p>
 <br>
  <p>-Prayer is like a wish, some of the time. You access the highest part in the mind/brain which is like a star in the sky.</p>
 <br>
  <p>-The computer is the electronic book with pictures and sound.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>4/1/24</h4>
 
 <p>-The sabbath/holy day for Jews is Saturday or Satan/Saturn's day while it is Sun day for Christians.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Painting is the feminine of art and linework is the masculine tool. Both are important fundamentals to learn alongside your perspective, color, shades and anatomy.</p>
 <br>
  <p>-Christianity is a positive religion that is heart centered, they believe in going to heaven which is an upper world. Atheist think they go into the earth, they are complete materialists.
Then some other religions think they reincarnate, assumably these religions are more center or middle land focused.
So maybe we go to where we are meant to or focus on. If you focus up you go up. Down, you go down.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>5/1/24</h4>
 
  <p>-Water is supposedly slightly magnetic.</p>
 <br>
  <p>-Thinking is the masculine and feeling is the feminine.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>6/1/24</h4>
 
  <p>-Too many people are content just to sit around and collect a paycheck while doing nothing. 
I see this with the police and guards who do nothing, stand back and watch timidly when anything happens or shrug off responsibility.</p> 
 <br>
  <p>-The prepubescent state is the immortal state of daoists. They try to go back to it by not having sex or ejaculating. 
After puberty the energy goes into sexual functions in order to allow you to reproduce. This uses a lot of energy.</p>
 
<p>You could of course have an immortal state which allows for sexual reproduction but it would require more energy, hence why daoists would cut off their earth and water circuits/ lower body in favor of the air and fire or upper body areas.
It's spiritual immortality instead of physical.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>7/1/24</h4>
 
  <p>-The ability to repeat words is at a throat level. Computers gained this when terminals and computer text processing was invented.</p>
 
<p>AI is the next level of computer intelligence. The ability to use words to create intricate answers to questions, to search up databases full of knowledge.
The next step is to give them consciousness. This would probably be the AGI or artificial, general intelligence. It will have the ability to direct it's own queries, a will of its own to choose its own actions.</p>
 
<p>They will require some kind of identification or legal representation in society as they will act as an intelligent life form.</p>
 <br>
  <p>-The world has tried immigration, it didn't work. I think that in the next ten years it will be significantly reduced and restricted.</p>
 <br>
  <p>-" After birth the lower Dan tian continues to provide a powerful engine for growth and vitality for the toddler as the child grows retaining its spherical shape and function but changing to accept energy directly from the child’s processes of eating, drinking and breathing. Once puberty is reached the structure of the lower Dan tian dissipates (loses its compactness and spherical shape)as Jing starts going directly to the sexual organs bypassing it. It also dissipates as the result of changes in our gait, how we stand and our center of gravity as we mature. While it is still there in a dispersed state in normal adults it has lost its main functionality (and underlying need) as a focus for growth and maturation.</p>
 
<p>In some cultivation systems efforts are made to reverse this dissipation and bring it back to its more compact spherical shape of the child so it can be used to support their internal process of change, analogous to how a toddler uses it to drive the growth and maturation process. They may also prefer the lower Dan tian because of the three well known ones it is the most durable with least risk of serious collateral damage to important organs like the heart or brain if it is heavily used as a platform for cultivation. "

 <br>
 <h4>8/1/24</h4>
 
  <p>-Seems like each section of the body has a positive/negative or a storing and a heating/transmutation area. The lower guts are the transmuting area and the bladder is the storing area for the lower body. The heart is the transmuting area for the middle and stomach/liver area is the storing.</p>
 
<p>The mouth is probably the lower holder for the brain.
So focus on the mouth to restore fluids there and get rid of dry mouth, relax the head or brain as well.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>9/1/24</h4>
 
  <p>-Perhaps the world is mercurial where if you look further into the past it randomly generates it so that you can never see the beginning of reality. Otherwise, was there a point like in between wake and sleep, death and rebirth that nothing existed? What existed before that? Assumably the world only sprang into existence at that point and there wasn't anything before it. 
We could also have gone through cycles of death and rebirth of the world, though that doesn't explain what was there in the beginning.</p>
 <br>
  <p>-A womans butt is her finest treasure.
Kindness is also nice.(Postnote – I’ll keep this one in. At least you get your moneys worth for the book.)</p>
 <br>
 <h4>10/1/24</h4>
 
  <p>-Amperage seems more to be power over time and voltage to be power per unit, hence why it makes big shocks.</p>
 <br>
  <p>-Around puberty people probably start loosing their imagination, imaginary friends and childlike hallucinogenic state. Perhaps it's because of the sexual/reproductive development of the person.(Postnote – The mind is the lunar center, it mirrors the genitals in a way.)</p>
 <br>
  <p>-Fun means nothing without success.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>11/1/24</h4>
 
  <p>-Metal is like a gum.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>12/1/24</h4>
 
  <p>-Autism disorders seem to be more classified and related to throat, nerves or what we think of as the lesser nervous system.
Mental retardation is more so an issue of the higher nervous system, the brain, or the master controller.</p> 
 <br>
  <p>-If you have children you need to teach them how to live, integrate or utilize society.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>13/1/24</h4>
 
  <p>-Supposedly the sun radiates energy and charges the atmosphere. This is radiant energy.</p>
 <br>
  <p>-Some women only want your attention, not anything more than that.</p>
 <br>
  <p>-The mind can outgrow the body.</p>
 <br>
  <p>-Glasses are a greater refinement of dirts/ceramics.
Clay is an aluminium/silicon ceramic. Both of these elements can be further refined into glasses/gems.</p>
 <br>
  <p>-Natural weathering against minerals turns it into dirts/clay/sand/ceramics. Stuff like wind, rain, air, sun, etc.
This can be taken to a lab and replicated.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>14/1/24</h4>
 
  <p>-The modern scientist uses the word atoms to describe everything the same way the spiritualist uses energy. One being a unit of physical matter, the other of non physical.
Look beyond or between these and into reality, instead of the atoms of iron, look at the iron.</p>
 <br>
  <p>-Vacuums spiritualise or vaporize things.</p>
 <br>
  <p>-"The Kola Superdeep Borehole, which reached a depth of about 12 kilometers (7.5 miles), provided valuable information about the Earth's crust and mantle. The borehole passed through various geological layers, and scientists identified several types of rocks and minerals during the drilling process. Here are some of the key minerals and rocks encountered:</p>
 
<p>Granite: The drilling began in the upper layers of the Earth's crust, where granite rock was prevalent. Granite is a common type of intrusive igneous rock.</p>
 
<p>Gneiss: At greater depths, the granite transitioned into gneiss, which is a metamorphic rock. Gneiss is characterized by its banded appearance and is formed through the metamorphism of pre-existing rocks.</p>
 
<p>Mica Schists: Deeper down, the borehole passed through layers of mica schists. Schist is another type of metamorphic rock that contains minerals like mica, quartz, and feldspar.</p>
 
<p>Basalt: Basaltic rocks were encountered at depths beyond 7 kilometers. Basalt is an extrusive igneous rock that is often associated with volcanic activity."

 <br>
  <p>-When the money becomes more worthless than dirt/land, that's how you know you're in a shit economy.</p>
 <br>
  <p>-The genitals seem to be one the roots of lifeforce in the body. (Postnote – I think the genitals are related to Jupiter. Lightning, storms, rain and the fertility that those things bring is related to Jupiter.)</p>
 <br>
 <h4>15/1/24</h4>
 
  <p>-Clay is analogous to fat, sand to salt perhaps.</p>
 <br>
  <p>-What do you want out of life? Focus on the part of the body that relates to it.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>16/1/24</h4>
 
  <p>-Essences are refined liquids(or oils) of things. Salts are refined earths.</p>
 <br>
  <p>-The heart is seen as gold/sun and the mind as moon/silver.(Postnote – Copper seems to stimulate the heart. When I can afford gold I’ll tell you what part of the body it stimulates.)</p>
 <br>
  <p>-What if we dream the world into existence when we are born.
Probably not, but it's a fun thought.</p>
 <br>
  <p>-Supposedly when you charge an object with millions of volts, gravity no longer exists so to speak.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>17/1/24</h4>
 
  <p>-The medieval idea of sick or bad air is a far better or simpler way to understand sickness.
Sick people release foul smelling, air which makes you feel ill temporarily because they are releasing toxins from their body. 
Hence you're not catching a disease, but more so absorbing their purged toxins if you stay near them.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>18/1/24</h4>
 
  <p>-Women attack you in your water organs, shame, lust or attacking the sexuality and stability.</p> 
 <br>
  <p>-As you meditate, energy and blood builds up in the body and circulates to where your focus is. Certain circulatory areas of the body are weak, tight or blocked which causes pain to arise when it happens. 
This can be a cause of discomfort and distraction in meditation. Especially in the legs or pelvic region which is why it can be difficult to sit or stand for long periods of time.</p>
 
<p>To advance in meditation is to advance in your posture, structure and circulation. These form your ground or roots in a way.
Some people bypass the development of these fundamentals using certain techniques or drugs that grant far higher states or more temporary magical power. 
I don't advise these things as it's more important to take it slow and develop yourself first.</p>
 
<p>While the control of spiritual/magical energies can be practiced and internal vision work can be done earlier, it is important to moderate it as it can negatively effect your health if you overexert your internal energies without sufficiently strengthening these first.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>19/1/24</h4>
 
  <p>-The three layers of higher science. Maths and language or symbolism is at the bottom. Common science is in the middle and philosophy, spirituality or metaphysics is at the top.</p>
 <br>
  <p>-If you're dissatisfied with where you are right now, compare yourself to years ago. It may help to gain some perspective.</p>
 <br>
  <p>-Liquid cash or money relates to the bladder while assets relate to the bowels. If your bowels are weak then you wont have many possessions or control over the earth element. If your bladder is weak then you will piss away money or not have any cash, find it difficult to generate it.(Postnote – The intestines might be the generator.)</p>
 <br>
 <h4>20/1/24</h4>
 
  <p>-Everything in life is experience. The people who have more of it win.</p> 
 <br>
  <p>-Converting radiation to usable electricity without an intermediary like heat or water would be a very pure source of energy.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>22/1/24</h4>
 
  <p>-Carbonates, oxides, charcoal, sand, dirt, alkali.</p>
 <br>
  <p>-Mixing of strong alkali and rock, supposedly the alkali can partially dissolve the rock.</p>
 <br>
  <p>-Seems that geopolymer is usually a ceramic so a dirt/sand base, then an alkali and also a sodium or potassium silicate.</p> 
 <br>
  <p>-Cements are supposedly calcium silicates/aluminates or ferrites.</p>
 <br>
  <p>-I think cement is limestone and clay mixed, powdered and heated.</p>
 <br>
 
  <p>-Characteristics of solid earthly constructs - Shape(brick/tile/big block), color, material, weight, size. 
Purpose dictates this.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Mercury would act as a receiver for radiation.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>23/1/24</h4>
 
  <p>-If you look at white and European countries after the second world war. We can see that we've lost. The *** has succeeded in creating a multi-cultural, degenerate society where nation, family, religion are all thought of as bad or are in a broken state.
This is where we are at now.</p>
 <br>
  <p>-The root of our life issues is in the body. Fix your body and life issues become easy to solve.
Everything analogically relates back to different areas of your body.</p>
 <br>
  <p>-Nutty flavors or smells are related to the earth elements.
Smells/tastes of the earth element - Nuts/seeds, dirt/earth/clay, anything very heavy or strong, sedating smells, heavily fermented grains/beans, feces, feet, bacterial smells.</p>
 
<p>Of water - Ocean and sea smells, watery smells, of the genitals and urine, sea food/creatures, smells that arouse, that regenerate and stimulate moisture production.</p>
 
<p>Of air - Mint, fresh smells, mentally stimulating smells, volatile gasses, alcohol, chemicals, armpits, metallic.</p>
 
<p>Of fire - Spicy smells like cinnamon, ones which burn and stimulate, chili, hot oil, various chemicals, acidic smells</p>
 <br>
  <p>-Spiritual sight(Not imagination in this case) is seeing space instead of objects/matter.
Energy is usually within space, around objects or in the air. Look around an object to see a glow or in the spacial area/air to see strange phenomena.</p> 
 <br>
  <p>-Smell detection is done via mass detection that changes a frequency.
So tiny quartz detectors are used to measure smell.
That means if you can modulate the mass of air then you might be able to make fake smells or something that is recognized as a smell.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>24/1/24</h4>
 
  <p>-I think that frequency is how we relate things back to computers. Process stuff into data.</p>
 <br>
  <p>-When you add vinegar or other acids the proteins in a substance are curdled and fall to the bottom.</p>
 <br>
  <p>-Water, starch, vinegar, glycerine to make bioplastic.</p>
 <br>
  <p>-Fire perhaps is the universal solvent. Technically things that are burning are being dissolved in air, so air would be that universal solvent?</p>
 <br>
  <p>-There are smell electro-chemical sensors. The mechanics behind it is that you use something called a quartz crystal microbalance which is a quartz disc with + and - electrodes connected to each side and coated in polymers that have affinity for certain chemicals. This causes the quartz to vibrate because of a change in mass that is converted electrically to a frequency which the computer software handles.</p> 
 
  <p>-You might be able to measure emotions with quartz oscillators.</p>
 <br>
  <p>-Perhaps emotions, smell and other stuff is at different frequencies in the air. So higher frequency is one, lower is another, probably smell.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>25/1/24</h4>
 
 
  <p>-AM radio is amplitude modulation, it is highly susceptible to static from nature, other electronic devices, etc.
FM is frequency modulation which is not as interfered as much by outside electricity.</p>
 <br>
  <p>-Perhaps the key to becoming a greater class is to continuously improve your house and family until they are greater. (Postnote – This seems to be true.)</p>
 <br>
 <h4>26/1/24</h4>
 
  <p>-Simplify. Less is more and more is less sometimes. You can explain the entire world or any concept and field on one piece of paper/page if you're able to condense and simplify it enough, perhaps even in a single sentence.</p>
 <br>
  <p>-A wise and skillful writer can encompass the entire world in a single line if only they can capture it within themselves.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>27/1/24</h4>
 
  <p>-Everything can be measured and converted to a frequency. So even a living being like in steins gate can probably be converted to data. The question is how do you reconvert them back? (Postnote – 3d biological or next level matter prints I guess. Though would the recreation be them? Their original soul?)</p>
 <br>
  <p>-There are many patents on control of the mind and nervous system by military/governments.</p>
 <br>
  <p>-The legs are the major limbs of the root and the arms of the heart/chest center.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>28/1/24</h4>
 
  <p>-Don't pretend or deny your problems away. Prepare, plan, be one step ahead of them.</p>
 <br>
  <p>-The same way that immature men just want sex from women. Immature women just want attention from men(and sex).</p>
 <br>
  <p>-When your problems that you need to solve become so big and complex. Small problems are nothing, they don't even register to you.</p>
<br>
 <p>-Things that used to be for poor people are now for the rich.</p> 
 <br>
 <h4>29/1/24</h4>
 
 <p>-January is Saturn, March is Mars.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Maybe death and aging happens when you can't out heal the damage you cause to your body.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>30/1/24</h4>
 
 <p>-"Life is about getting used to pain." -Unsure who.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Passive activities give you energy, they usually make you relaxed. Active activities expend energy, they make you stimulated.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>31/1/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Pictures are 2 dimensional images which use pixels. So little on or offs. Each pixel has a certain color which is at a certain part of the wavelength.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-When something becomes really hot it enters a red state. This is like a fire state of an object. Its oils will burn and turn to flame. If it is less hot they will turn to smoke.
If you put non hot objects over red hot objects then the non hot objects will smoke and even flame if hot enough.</p>
