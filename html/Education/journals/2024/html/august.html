 <h4>1/8/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Function generator.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-TENS units stimulate muscles.</p> 
 <br>
 <h4>3/8/24</h4>

 <p>-TPU flex plastic.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>4/8/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Cold creates/lowers/coagulates, heat destroys/sublimates/raises.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-To be able to relate to women you need to be at least middle class because they embody it as men embody the lower and upper class.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>5/8/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Polyamide.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>6/8/24</h4>
 
 <p>-You can use your mind to do work, to condense things mentally into doable ways or methods, different techniques and such. This is an alternative of strength, which is also valid and good in its own way. Technique is another way.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>7/8/24</h4>
 
 <p>-When motors operate for long periods of time the heat can damage the magnets. This causes it to loose power.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Drive train is the path of movement, physically with gears, belts, chains, etc.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-You can use intelligence to conquer obstacles and problems. See everything as a puzzle, a riddle. How do you put the pieces together to get the result you want? 
Imagine, visualize, test, strategise, reason. 
What tool works? What method. What material. 
Think.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>8/8/24</h4>
 
 <p>-I think that people have become more non physical which is why they are focusing on that area. So real issues aren't being solved so to speak but mental ones.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-More food products need cute mascots on their packaging.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Each of the features of the head relates to an element. I think that the eyes are related to fire, mouth to water, perhaps ears are air and nose is earth? Or Jaw is also related to earth. Nose could then be air. Though I'm not sure. Hair to electricity perhaps.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Desire can cause action. Unfulfilled desire can cause pain.
Control your desires as they can lead to undesired consequences if fulfilled or suffering if not.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>8/8/24</h4>
 
 <p>-The magnets in electromagnetic motors can loose their strength over time or due to misuse. If the motor gets physically jammed/locked and you run too high a current through it, then the motor will heat similar to induction coils I think. This high heat damages the magnets and then the motors ability to have strength/torque. 
Speed seems to increase due to a lack of resistance perhaps, but the motor is mostly useless if it has no strength.
Current seems to relate to torque but produces heat while higher voltages seem to relate to speed but lack strength if not enough current is applied. 
Maybe a solution is a better drive train with gears.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Maybe the nose and ears are both air organs since they take in air. 
Sound is like refined air.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>9/8/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Rest and build up passive energy before doing important work.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-The internet, the world of the heart(desire, emotion) and the mind (Vision, hearing, mind).</p>
 <br>
 <h4>10/8/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Using screws or nails at an angle lets you connect one beam of wood to another without using brackets or joints. It's also stronger than straight on.
You can drill straight on, then angle the drill once it's in a little to get a pilot hole for it.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-When repairing something you want to understand the intentions and methods of the original builder. 
Sometimes repairing can be more difficult than building from the ground up. But that requires more resources.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Cities embody the belly and heart. Socializing and eating, consuming products/buying them. Bars especially are a small scale representation of that; food and conversation.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Hex head screws have three main qualities. Length, hex head width and screw width. 
You're drilling a hole the size of the screw width, or a little smaller. Then you need a socket and ideally impact driver or wrench the same size as the head.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Water is kind of profound the way that it manifests out of the sky from I assume a negative electromagnetic charge that is a cloud.</p>
 <br>
 
 <h4>11/8/24</h4>
 
 <p>-For AI to become AGI, it probably needs to go a layer beyond language into the realm of thought. When it is able to think for its self in a programmed loop, then it can become even more like a mental being, beyond just repeating words and processing data.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-I wonder if you mixed a capacitor and inductor, aka making both an electrostatic and magnetic storage device. An electromagnetic battery.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Inductors store energy in a magnetic field and capacitors store it in an electrostatic field. You can make them both yourself. An inductor is just an electromagnet more or less, iron wrapped by copper wire.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-For a simple capacitor, I layered 3 pieces of paper and 2 of aluminum foil together in a sandwich with paper above, in between and below the two foil sheets which don't touch. You tape wire to each sheet of foil then wrap it into a roll for space efficiency. It's just like a galvanic cell/battery except with no electrolyte. So it works off electrostatics instead of galvanic corrosive chemistry.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-You can test the feeling you get from magnetic fields and electrostatic fields by holding them in your hand while powering them with a desk generator.
Electrostatic is stimulating and light while magnetic is heavy and grounding.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>12/8/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Perhaps personality is dipping into the lower world of the heart.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Maybe the condensing/coagulating force is cold, so then freezing something might work to crystallize/physicalize it. Similarly how heat vaporizes/spiritualizes.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Would capacitors or electrostatic resonators harvest electrostatic energy? Or would electromagnets?
Electromagnet wrapped with a electrostatic accumulator. Maybe connected in series, layers of copper coil, aluminium foil and paper.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Perhaps in between the earths magnetic field and skies electrostatic field exists a natural electromagnetic field that can be harvested by a resonator that can receive this energy.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>13/8/24</h4>
 
 <p>-I think that putting things in between capacitor foil is putting it in an electrostatic field.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>15/8/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Supposedly more cerebral spinal fluid fixes brain issues/neurological issues. Clearing out toxins and repairing stuff I imagine.
So then brain tonification and emf stimulation of it should help.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>16/8/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Electrical stuff is almost like a cheat code or a way to go above reality and control/command it.</p>
<br>
 <h4>17/8/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Qi tonic - Licorice root, Rehmannia, Tribulus, Reishi, cinnamon, astragalus, Dongquai, ginseng, Epimedium.</p>
 
<p>Mind mix - Mint, bacopa, ginseng, ginko, Eucalyptus, eyebright, gotu kola, calamus.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Amplifier, signal generator, coil.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>18/8/24</h4>
 
 <p>-I figured out how pc hardware converts to programming. Electronics build logic circuits like “and”, “or”, “if”, timers, etc and then they build integrated circuits and CPUs. This connected with memory and voltages are like the controllers and communication devices of these.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Learn to make logic circuits.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>19/8/24</h4>
 
 <p>-I think a love of beauty keeps one on the right path as beauty is analogous to natural harmony. As long as it's not in excess.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-"The magnetic field is basically the Lorentz transform of the electric field" - Lord Miles.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>20/18/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Assumably the nonphysical senses would be located in the body above the regular senses like above the ears for nonphysical or mental hearing. Then perhaps a kind of subconscious version would be below the sensory organ.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Take care of physical objects and they will last. Repair them if they break.</p> 
 <br>
 <p>-Bland and simple food is grounding and good for the body. Interesting and stimulating food is good for the mind and soul.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>23/8/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Simmer or dissolve things down to get their essence. Burn them down to get their ash. Distill them to get their liquids.</p> 
 <br>
 <p>-There's power in going beyond despair, depression, fear.
There's power in going beyond negative emotions.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>24/8/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Maths is like a symbolic undercurrent that allows you to predict things.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-The morning feels slower than the afternoon and far slower than the night, time wise.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-I think salesmen subconsciously induce anxiety and use anxiety tactics to get you to buy quickly.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Paints or colors are magical in a way. They were rarer to find or make back in the past and the ingredients had relating physical objects to the properties of the color.</p>
<br>
 <h4>25/8/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Failures are the steps to success.(Postnote – As long as you learn from them and be harshly realistic to what caused the failure.)</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Perhaps dirt could be refined into a further form. Try calcining it.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Silicon is like archetypal earth in a way, since the soil is mostly made of it.(Postnote – Interesting that silicon metal has a strong grounding effect on the body like lead.)</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Soil seems to be both organic and non organic as to the materials in it.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-When you burn down things you get the mineral/non organic materials. The distillate I guess is technically organic?</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Organic chemicals contain carbon and hydrogen bonds in their molecule. Carbon is archetypal earth while hydrogen is archetypal water. Usually organic chemicals can also contain sulfur, phosphorus, nitrogen and oxygen sometimes too.</p>
 
<p>Non organic are metallic and semi metals as well as their unique chemicals like carbonates, oxides, chlorides, etc.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Understand what makes stuff into polymers. Perhaps if you distill their oil then you can do something to solidify them. I imagine polymers are a form of solidified oils of different materials.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>26/8/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Moisture/water seems to be the main causer for corrupting houses. Make sure it drains down properly and doesn't sit. Angling structures roofs help. Try to avoid plastic mesh nets as it can trap water. Silicon fillers can sometimes trap water too depending on what it's used on. Excess untrimmed plants can stop the light drying moist soil or other areas which can cause some damage to posts.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Occultic arts - that relating to the nervous system or fifth element.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>27/8/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Your intelligence is your ability to understand things, life, fields of study, etc. It seems to dictate how fast you pick them up. 
The more you learn, the easier it is to learn other things because you build up a base of knowledge and experience which helps in new fields.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-I don't have any problems that money can't fix.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-I'm gonna go fishing when all of this is over.</p>
<br>
 <h4>28/8/24</h4>
 
 <p>-I think silver might be the magical metal. Blue mana potions from silver.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>29/8/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Flesh seems to coagulate or thicken when cut or injured. It reminds me of plastic melting and cooling.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-I just remembered. I was riding on the road yesterday late evening and saw what I think was the sun. It was huge like a full moon and you could look right into it. It didn't hurt your eyes and was incredibly orange. 
I imagine it relates to the ending mercury retrograde.
Usually the sun seems to have a dark center or cause that effect on your eyes when you look into it. This was just a giant orange ball, setting just above the horizon. Weird as.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>30/8/24</h4>

 <p>-Levels in society</p>
 <p>1 Homeless.</p>
 <p>2 Welfare and or at a home.</p>
 <p>3 Gig work, casual work.</p>
 <p>4 Full time or part time but below average income, low status job.</p>
 <p>5 Average income, average status job.</p>
 <p>6 Above average.</p>
 <p>7 High income (top 10%), high status job.</p>
 <p>8 Successful Business owner, above top 10%</p>
 <p>9 Top 1% income. Big business owner.</p>
 <p>10 Political class.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Holograms projected onto fog is an interesting concept because the old magicians used heavy smoke to allow a spiritual entity to manifest. Hypothetically the entity is some kind of electromagnetic being and it projects its self visibly onto this medium.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>31/8/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Writers block, mental exhaustion, brain fog and anything else that stops you from doing mental work can be partially alleviated by focusing in your head. These issues are usually a lack of mental circulation or mental energy, mana. Focusing there will send more energy up to your head. 
Don't do it all the time as it drains your lower stamina.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-I was thinking how life is like a game, you just gotta level up. You can buy whatever you want on ali***ress. The internet and computers makes it more and more like a video game system.
That's pretty cool.</p>
