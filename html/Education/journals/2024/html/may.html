 <h4>1/5/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Currently, manufacturing is a gold mine. Consumer house good are at an all time high in price.
Especially fancy or aesthetically designed stuff.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>2/5/24</h4>
 
 <p>-I was thinking that humans are the aliens. Maybe they fucked animals which made the people of other races, the lesser people.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>3/5/24</h4>
 
 <p>-In my explorations in magic last night I found that through using feeling to create energy then trying to make it heavy, the heaviness wants to go down, it is archetypal or prime weight. Lightness is the opposite and wants to go up.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Practicing temperature, weight and moisture might be a good start to magic. Also meditating on the mid head.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-I think that the Asian people are being mass imported to other countries to replace the native populations because they are a more subservient, slave like race and are easier to control and tax farm compared to the natives. Similar to how work is offshored for cheap. 
I imagine that robots will eventually replace these Asians and the natives. Ultimately those with power want cheaper and more efficient labor and an easier underclass to control.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-A country should create its own goods. Importing everything is foolish as it overloads your docks.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>4/5/24</h4>
 
 <p>-When drawing, don't over analyze and wonder if every little part is correct. It's important to get your drawing done first, then correct it later. When writing, just write, don't overthink about how you start your sentence or what words to use. You can edit it later. (Postnote – Worry and overthinking kill creativity. Usually when you are inexperienced these feelings arise in your work.)</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Learn to do, do lots.</p> 
 
 <p>-When your house and garden is dirty and broken it causes an internal feeling of tension and discomfort. A clean and fixed space causes relaxation and peace.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-I believe that women focus on the tone and men focus on what is being said.</p> 
 <br>
 <p>-Eventually prey runs out of energy and becomes slower. Even if your strikes do not hit it at first, keep trying until you exhaust it and it becomes slow.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Deconstruct and reconstruct cheap appliances to see how they work.
Learn more about circuit boards and micro circuits and appliances.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Cultivate the mind, you'll need your intelligence in the coming years.</p>
<br>
 <h4>5/5/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Transformers seem to be two copper coils of wire with different length around a piece of iron.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-I think heat is the masculine or positive force that stimulates growth while moisture is the feminine force that gives a womb/space to growth.
The feminine force in excess causes putrefying or rotting while the masculine force in excess dries out and sterilizes.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Circle magic is to stimulate different angles of the body, this can be done at will with thought. If you're able to segment the body into its major areas, you can focus on these and activate different archetypes doing it.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>6/5/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Depending on the direction you spin a fan blade will depend on if air goes forwards or backwards.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Ebner effect - using electrostatic fields to genetically "level up" seeds, animals, etc.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>7/5/24</h4>
 
 <p>-You can focus on any part of the body and apply mental-physical pressure or essentially, muscular tension and if you hold that pressure, it will train and enhance that part of the body. The brain, eyes, genitals, heart, core muscles, etc. 
Balance the force as to not block your circulation while doing it. It's a bit like refining metal or medicines.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-A magician should excel in all things as they understand the truth about the world, it's laws and cycles.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Turns out electric coffee grinders are pretty much just an ac motor and a switch. Electric fans are similar but with some components to start it and for the controls.</p>
 
<p>Electric heaters main functional parts are a motor for the fan and heating element then component boards to regulate and logic boards if there is a microcontroller in it for the controls.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-You need to be very gentle when opening up electronics and investigating or repairing them.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>8/5/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Static high voltages cause levitation.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Georges Lachowski coil.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>9/5/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Stress is mental/neurological/nervous system and brain overload or overwork. Exhaustion is physical/bodily/muscular overwork. Both effect each other, so stress eventually starts to drain from the organs and body.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Stars probably glow because they are high voltage thingos in a vacuum.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Plastic is meta material. In between water and earth, fully customiseable.
Metal as well to an extent.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-I think ageing is a buildup of exhaustion and damage that the body doesn't have the time and leisure to fix/heal. That's why people who don't live very stressful lives look young and almost childlike. Similar a wise person will look young as well because they are able to heal their bodies from this progressive damage.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>10/5/24</h4>
 
 <p>-We'll be 3d printing vehicle frames and plates in the future.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Science and data are two different things. Data is a tool to help you plot and record things.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>10/5/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Lorentz force.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Magnetic energy is like earth energy of the electrical realm.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-When you speak or make sound you're creating a real thing, though spiritual in nature. It dissipates into the air and becomes nothing as the echo fades. But for a moment it was there.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>12/5/24</h4>
 
 <p>-The computer world is a land of symbolic reality.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Any high calorie foods with dairy in it is great for recovery. The body seems to want a bunch of calories to heal from exercise, stress and work.</p>
<br>
 <h4>13/5/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Nature is the source of things and the source of nature is energy patterns.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Electrical Plasma, ionic winds and magnetic fields are kind of like opposites.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Assumably orgone accumulators are dielectric accumulators.(Postnote – Fancy ass way to say a capacitor or electrostatic battery. Though more like an electrostatic antenna, gathering from the worlds energy perhaps.)</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Find the source of vitality in the body.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-I want to make a book or virtual experience that explains all of reality simply so that others don't need to suffer.(Postnote – My current attempt thus far - https://kurenai5000.github.io/PersonalWebsite/html/Education/UniversalIndex.html)</p>
 <br>
 <h4>14/5/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Physically high voltage is tension.
So maybe you could produce it with tension in the body.
Projecting that out.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-I think ac is tense-relax-tense-relax while dc would just be tense. Magnetism might be relax.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Being zapped by high voltage is not fun, not at all. My body tensed and relaxed very quickly and it felt like a pulsation travelled up my hand and dissipated around my wrists.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-High voltage is pure life energy.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Jets sound like they are electrically charged.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Magnetic fields induce relaxation in the body and high voltage electrostatic creates muscular tension. 
I believe this is the working principle behind a magnetic bed sheet for relaxation or an electro muscular stimulator machine that pulses and causes you to contract in waves.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Protein is like bio plastic.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>16/5/24</h4>
 
 <p>-The strong person is strong because they are always putting their focus in the muscles. The smart person is smart because they are always putting their focus in the brain.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>18/5/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Red soft drinks are always very delicious. Be careful of the ones colored with carmine or natural colors 120 which is made from bugs.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>19/5/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Build a boat.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-There's probably some super nutrient from dirt and water you can make.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Keep your kidneys warm during winter.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Perhaps women live live through and with people while men live with and through objects.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-I really wanna mine.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Learn metal casting.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Assumably hydrogen is the prime or first matter, at least if we look at chemistry.
Energy is another idea, light, darkness, space, electromagnetism. Dirt even if we want to use the word matter as it is.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>20/5/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Silver iodide causes rain clouds supposedly.</p>
<br>
 <p>-Clay is the fat of earth. Sand is its salt.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Time camera hypothesis
Part 1 - Alloys which contain many metals made into many antennas to receive all wavelengths. The antennas are interconnected.
Part 2 - Modulation. Selector that operates at the speed of light.
Part 3 - Screen or viewing device.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Time travel might be possible by using super antennas to capture all wavelengths, modulation to target a specific time and then somehow transporting the matter or body and energy to that time.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-I think the time camera is essentially just a radio connected to a TV that has super antennas.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Audio is analogous to ac current because sound waves oscillate.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Friction creates heat and also electricity I think if the right materials are used.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-"Microwave ovens work by using a device called a magnetron to generate microwave radiation, which is a type of electromagnetic radiation with a frequency of approximately 2.45 GHz. The microwave radiation is used to heat food by causing the water molecules within the food to vibrate rapidly, which in turn generates heat through a process called dielectric heating. The energy produced by a microwave oven is primarily in the form of microwave radiation, which is a type of non-ionizing radiation that is generally considered safe for human exposure at the levels produced by microwave ovens. The power output of a microwave oven is typically measured in watts, with most domestic microwave ovens having power outputs ranging from 600 to 1200 watts. The high voltage circuit in a microwave oven is used to power the magnetron, which is a type of vacuum tube that is used to generate the microwave radiation. The high voltage is generated by a transformer, which converts the incoming AC power from the electrical grid into a high voltage DC current that is used to power the magnetron. The electromagnetic fields (EMFs) produced by a microwave oven are different from the EMFs produced by other sources, such as power lines or electrical appliances, primarily due to the frequency and wavelength of the radiation. Microwave radiation has a wavelength of approximately 12.2 cm, which is much longer than the wavelengths of visible light or ultraviolet radiation, and much shorter than the wavelengths of radio waves or power line frequencies. The frequency of the microwave radiation produced by a microwave oven is determined by the design of the magnetron and the resonant cavity in which it is housed. The frequency of 2.45 GHz is chosen because it is a frequency at which water molecules can absorb the energy of the microwave radiation efficiently, leading to rapid heating of the food. In summary, microwave ovens work by using a magnetron to generate microwave radiation at a frequency of approximately 2.45 GHz, which is used to heat food through a process called dielectric heating. The energy produced by a microwave oven is primarily in the form of microwave radiation, with power outputs ranging from 600 to 1200 watts. The high voltage circuit in a microwave oven is used to power the magnetron, which generates the microwave radiation. The electromagnetic fields produced by a microwave oven are different from other sources of EMFs due to the frequency and wavelength of the microwave radiation." -Either GabAI or ChatGPT</p>

 <p>-Mr Mythos put out an interesting video on the Chronovisor or time camera. It brings up some interesting ideas. Supposedly the engineering was essentially just antennas of different metals and probably sizes connected together that pick up a huge band of frequencies, then modulation to decide the time and a screen to display/output device to watch it.</p>
 
<p>It brings ideas of how radio and emf transmission works. You're essentially just receiving and sending oscillations of electromagnetic fields, think AC power and a magnet. Sound for example is an up and down wave which is analogous to AC power. Hence audio speakers and microphones are just plates or membranes or something which can vibrate or oscillate connected to a positive and negative electrode. This then transmits to and from using a coil(emf emission through ac power).</p>
 
<p>So the time television just used a modulated antenna, at least to my understanding. Instead of receiving TV signals you receive the past or future by tuning into the frequency of that time and place. Assuming everything is just a frequency in some way or form, then that would explain it.
Time travel would be similar except you'd attach this tech to a portal or matter transferrer. 
So when we have portals we can also have singular entity time travel.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>21/5/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Electronics seem to fall under a category of body - antennas or receivers, power devices. Heart - modulation, buttons, dongles(keyboard, mouse, touch) Mind - Sensory devices like screens, headphones, tactile devices.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Mushrooms are like bugs of the plant realm.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-"Quartz glass is rated as having a high positive charge in the triboelectric series" -Unknown source.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Hypothetically if the body dies from shock, physical damage, poison or something else besides "natural death" then perhaps it could be revived. I imagine if the persons spirit or energy body is strong enough then they might be conscious in that energy body state, able to see their physical body and awaiting "re-possession" of the physical body. Perhaps this is what happens when someone gets hit badly in the head and become unconscious. Sleep could be said of a kind of temporary death, though the body in that case is still alive, but it is similar.</p>
 
<p>"Natural death" due to age would probably be when the spirit no longer can stand to live in the physical body due to excess damage, weakness, exhaustion, etc.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>22/5/24</h4>
 
 <p>-When reading someones words and advice you should ask yourself "Is coming from a place of proper experience? Or is it just an elaborate thought?".
I'm noticing how little grounding and reality many peoples words have. If you put them to the test they will probably crumble. That way you can avoid being mislead.
Not to try make myself an authority. Hold my own words to the same standards.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-The energy of anxiety and fear is very related to electrostatics. Pain as well.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Perhaps the manipulation of magnetism could lead to levitation.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Supposedly mixing shit in with things ferments them. To make fertiliser out of shells, bark, other stuff you can mix it in with shit.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Alchemically refining materials is analogical to the human bodies digestion.
Digestion is the breaking down of the foods or materials.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Chewing something and spitting it out might cause it to ferment if put in a proper area.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>23/5/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Shungite is interesting, it dulls the nerves and lets you relax a bit. Fairly grounding but not as sedating. Probably similar to lead. Is like graphite in physical form.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-If you want DIY experience, fix everything in your house, fix and maintain your own vehicle and start building your own furniture and tools when possible.
It all comes down to learning how to use tools, hardware and materials in the way you need in order to be able to build or maintain something.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-The white mans seasoning is salt.(Postnote – Or butter.)</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Phosphorus stones supposedly are those stones that spark when hit.</p>
 <br>
 <p>Kapton tape for electricals.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Diodes make power go in only one way.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>24/5/24</h4>
 
 <p>-You could probably use an electroscope to tell how high up you are the same way you tell direction with a compass.(Postnote – I didn’t realise this till editing but that would make surrounding directions magnetism while up and right electrostatic measuring. How fitting.)</p>
 <br>
 <h4>25/4/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Plasma is heavenly or divine fire.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Maybe turn an element into a plasma state in a vacuum chamber and then recondense it down, perhaps you could modify it to perform transmutation.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>26/5/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Centrifuging is a way to separate solids from liquids/oils.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-When a country stops manufacturing, this signals the start of its slow death. It's like when a youtube channel quits doing the cool stuff that made it interesting and just starts podcasting.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-The animes you like at the start of the season may not always be the ones you like at the end.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Resource gatherer, producer, processor, manufacturer, fixer.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>27/5/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Perhaps the boomers excessive hedonism and holidays are a way to deal with their oncoming death.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-In the past, everything sour was called a vinegar supposedly.</p>
<br>
 <h4>28/5/24</h4>

 <p>-Latin is the progenitor of most southern European languages, seemingly.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Maybe force is just a form of magnetic power. Maybe you can move objects with it similar to how high static charge can as well. Look into super strong magnetism.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Fixed and volatile conditions. Volatile conditions would be temporary like bad thoughts, mood swings, a short cold or short pain in the body. Fixed is a long term deficiency, long term chronic illness. Use more fixed medicines for that instead of a volatile medicine.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-"A carboxylate salt is a salt that is formed by the reaction of a carboxylic acid with a base, such as sodium hydroxide (NaOH) or potassium hydroxide (KOH). In this reaction, the carboxylic acid donates a proton (H+) to the base, forming a carboxylate ion (-COO-) and a hydroxide ion (OH-)." - Unknown source.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-"Alkaloid is a fixed sulfur" -Unknown source./<p>
 <br>
 <p>-Modern man extracts medicinal qualities from natural goods because they are unable to extract the qualities from them via eating or drawing their energy. When man is stronger, I think that they will be able to eat and assimilate all things and digest them.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Supposedly antimony is fairly Saturnian.
It purges poisons if made into a medicine.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>29/5/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Supposedly potassium carbonate can "fuse" minerals and get it into a soluble form. Maybe through heating it, not sure.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-"If potassium carbonate is left overnight it will liquefy and be used as a solvent with alcohol."
-Unknown source.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Supposedly the moon increases nitrogen.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-"Essential oil and purified plant salt to make volatile salt." -Unknown source.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Wearing lead interferes with near field communication/NFC technology.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Dry distilling stuff seems to volatilise it.
How would you fix things more then?</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Maybe the voltage of electrolysis gives different chemicals.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-A cauldron is a vessel, it goes inside the furnace. It is heated in order to transmute the material.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>30/5/24</h4>
 
 <p>-"If you have an electromotive force with an electrostatic charge you will achieve an electrogravitic propulsion." -Unknown source.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-An electric furnace/cauldron for alchemical transmutation.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Use the microwave as a stove.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-"The sun is an electrical transformer." -Unknown source.(Postnote – Maybe Eric Dollard said that.)</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Excess positive energy keeps someone in a perpetual state of childhood or a child like state. I believe that animals that change states like tadpoles or mosquito swimmers stay in those states if exposed to radium or other high energy materials/fields.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-You could say that everything is either a material or a field and that matter is a dense field and fields are subtle matter.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Pain feels like high voltage, like our own body zapping ourselves to tell us where it's at.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-I'm starting to wonder if chemical metal work is dependent on astrology. I seem to get different chemicals depending on different times.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>31/5/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Heating metal powder with carbonates is a way to keep them from melting but also be able to oxidize them.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Fermentation and gestation are two sides of the same coin. Fermentation volatilizes and is deconstructive while gestation is constructive and produces a material being. They both require, dark, moist and warm environments. They are both the originators or creators of life.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Experience is the master of physical reality.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Inverters convert DC to AC. Rectifiers convert AC to DC.</p>
