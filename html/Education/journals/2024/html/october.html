 <h4>1/10/24</h4>
 
 <p>-LGBT is told to younger people like teenagers and kids because they are malleable and usually in an easily traumatized state. Especially children or teens who never had a strong sense of self or gender will gravitate towards it. These people are usually failures and are physically ill/weak.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Electricity seems like the most quick, powerful and destructive method of breaking up metals followed by mineral acids. Fermenting seems like a lower, slower way.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>2/10/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Middle Europe seems to be the land of art and craft.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>3/10/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Extreme vibration causes the body to swell.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Holding tension is positive energy, relaxation is negative.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Adventure waits on the path you're putting off, rejecting or resisting. Not that you have to follow it. Stability is on the path that is familiar, the one you know.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>4/10/24</h4>
 
 <p>-"This is the same principle as how lightning makes crops grow.
Lightning causes nitrogen and oxygen in the air to react and turn into nitrogen dioxide, which dissolves in water." -Unknown source.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Supposedly if high voltage electrodes are placed in a sealed flask that it starts to make nitrogen dioxide gas. An orange gas.(Postnote – I think it needs 3500 degrees celsius to do it. I assume this is a fusion reaction.)</p>
 <br>
 <h4>7/10/24</h4>
 
 <p>-The crown of the head gives wisdom, the highest point of the brain. It goes beyond the mundane world of the senses. If you focus here it enhances your wisdom and feels like a crown is on your head because of the pressure created. You can ask yourself questions while focusing here and get good answers.
This is where sages and kings inhabit.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-I'm really starting to think that these recipes for the philosophers stones are just people chemically cracking minerals into their salt state.
Though how does that then make gold?</p>
 <br>
 <h4>8/10/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Medicine should be candy.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Michael Marcum time machine</p>
 <br>
 <h4>9/10/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Philadelphia experiment used rotating magnetic fields and radio frequency.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Art Bell radio.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-The Japanese essentially created the RPG game system and ideas. Their literature, comics and animation shows carry these systems onto them. 
The Chinese fantasy stories are more based on daoism which also have level based systems and an RPG like system to them but are more natural and practical while the Japanese systems are more the refined essence and systemised versions of reality.</p>
 <br>
 <h4>10/10/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Low frequencies under 30hz supposedly effect the brain.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-"Delta (0.5-4 Hz): Delta waves are the slowest brainwaves and are associated with deep, dreamless sleep, as well as meditative and highly relaxed states. They are typically found in infants and young children but can also appear in adults during deep meditation or sleep.</p>
 
<p>Theta (4-8 Hz): Theta waves are associated with light sleep, meditation, and daydreaming. They are also linked to increased creativity and intuition. Theta brainwaves are commonly found in adults during deep relaxation or meditation and in children during light sleep.</p>
 
<p>Alpha (8-13 Hz): Alpha waves are associated with a relaxed, alert, and conscious state. They are often found during quiet wakefulness, daydreaming, and light meditation. Alpha brainwaves are typically dominant in the occipital lobes (visual processing areas) and are thought to be involved in visual imagery and spatial awareness.</p>
 
<p>Beta (13-40 Hz): Beta waves are associated with active thinking, problem-solving, and concentration. They are typically found during periods of focused attention and active engagement with the environment. Beta brainwaves are dominant in the frontal lobes (executive function and decision-making areas) and are thought to be involved in higher cognitive processes.</p>
 
<p>Gamma (40+ Hz): Gamma waves are associated with heightened perception, consciousness, and information processing. They are often found during periods of intense concentration, learning, and problem-solving. Gamma brainwaves are thought to be involved in integrating information from different brain regions and facilitating complex cognitive processes." - Gab AI</p>
 <br>
 <p>-Another list is Delta (1-4), theta (4-8), alpha(8-12), beta (13-30), Low gamma (30-70), high gamma (70-150).
Maybe the brainwaves people have links them to what kind of personality they have, like an alpha male is usually in the alpha brainwave state or being relaxed but alert.</p>
 <br>
 <p>-"Antimony ore: Start with high-quality antimony ore, preferably stibnite (antimony sulfide). The ore can be obtained from China or other sources.
Roasting: Roast the antimony ore with charcoal or coke to produce the volatile oxide fume (Sb4O6), which can be collected and refined to obtain pure antimony.
Red glass: Create the red glass of antimony by reacting the antimony ore with potassium nitrate, acetic acid, potassium carbonate, and other ingredients, as described in Basil Valentine’s “Triumphant Chariot of Antimony”. This process yields a red glass that can be used as a precursor for making the oil of antimony.</p>
 
<p>Yellow glass: Alternatively, use the yellow glass of antimony, which can be obtained by following Valentine’s recipe or by using a different method. Dr. Lawrence Principe successfully made an oil from yellow glass, and it seems that yellow and red glass can be somewhat interchangeable.</p>
 
<p>Extraction: Extract the oil from the red or yellow glass using a solvent, such as vinegar, through repeated digestion and distillation processes. This step is described in Roger Bacon’s tract on preparing an oil from antimony.</p>
 
<p>Purification: Purify the extracted oil through further distillation and treatment with chemicals, as needed, to remove impurities and achieve the desired consistency and properties." -Unknown source. (Postnote – I left this in to illustrate the basic metallic alchemical work of refining it into a salt then oil. I’m not sure how rock solid this quote is otherwise though.)</p>
  <br>
 <h4>11/10/24</h4>
 
 <p>-So from water electrolysis you can make oxygen and hydrogen and from "air electrolysis" you can make nitrogen, maybe something else too. (Postnote – I guess that’s what fusion reactors are. A sparkgap in a vacuum chamber where you release gasses into. Heat it up real good with the sparkgap and fuse the gasses into new things.)</p>
  <br>
 <p>-1hz means one cycle a second. You can continue to go even further by having .5hz or two second per cycle, then 3 seconds, 4, etc. This is going towards infinity, the dao.</p>
   <br>
 <h4>12/10/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Crystal oscillators seem to work for kinetic sensors for an oscilloscope.
Perhaps if I amplify it, It can be a spiritual or air sensor for smells and sounds.
Maybe using a raw coil would work too? Or LC circuit.</p>
   <br>
 <p>-I've recently taken a liking to jelly and jelly candies. You can make thinner or thicker jelly by adding more or less gelatin, changing the density of it. I think If I add enough that I'll be able to make jelly candy that wont liquefy. Otherwise you mix your sugar and any flavourings into the water that gelatin is added to.</p>
   <br>
 <p>-I think medicine should be make into jelly candy or other forms of candy like in the past with honey herb pills. You can add certain supplements to the jelly like vitamin c for example too.</p>
   <br>
 <h4>13/10/24</h4>
 
 <p>-You can't defeat a man who has defeated himself.</p>
   <br>
 <p>-The legs seem like the bank of the body.(Butt and upper legs store the most energy.)</p>
   <br>
 <p>-Vibration is a great way to stimulate the body, you can put a vibration motor over accupoints.</p>
   <br>
 <p>-Most basic electric circuits seem to be a power source(battery or power circuit), modulation (on off switch, volume potentiometer) and the major functional component(speaker, heat element, light, motor).</p>
   <br>
 <p>-Glass reminds me of jelly. It's like super coagulated earthly jelly.</p>
   <br>
 <p>-Get the blood to flow smoothly.
Find the blockages where it does not flow to and open them up.</p>
   <br>
 <p>-Computers are electromagnetic interfaces. Eventually they'll encompass all of the senses and possibilities, to simulate all things or send and receive all things.</p>
   <br>
 <h4>14/10/24</h4>
 
 <p>-I think mana is stored in the lower back of the head, the cerebellum maybe?</p>
   <br>
 <p>-You can use a coil/inductor and connect it to a diode rectifier to make a wireless power circuit to convert ac to dc if using a tesla coil.
Essentially just receive with a coil, convert to dc and then use that to connect to your circuits battery/power circuit area.</p>
   <br>
 <h4>15/10/24</h4>
 
 <p>-I can store and drain mana in crystals.(Postnote – I’ll make a video on this eventually. Otherwise you just focus on the object and flow mental energy into it.).</p>
   <br>
 <p>-Mana starts to become dense when you compress a lot of it.</p>
   <br>
 <p>-Maybe imbue medicines with mental energy.</p>
   <br>
 <h4>16/10/24</h4>
 
 <p>-The amount of energy I can store in a crystal is way more than in pla plastic.</p>
 
<p>Lead doesn't seem to store any or else it's super, super dense energy. You have to do it slowly.
Copper also seems slow. Maybe metal is just not a good store of energy.(Postnote – Water stores a lot of it too.)</p>
 
 <p>-When traumatized, a second you is created psychologically that protects you from the scary or bad things that hurt you.</p>
   <br>
 <h4>17/10/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Naivete gives way to understanding as you grow and engage with life and the world.</p>
   <br>
 <h4>18/10/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Supposedly a coil kind of acts like a capacitor as the electrostatic is trapped in between the layers of wire. So it resonates, then a capacitor resonates it too.</p>
   <br>
 <p>-If you can learn all of the individual pieces of a system and the physics or laws that drive them then you'll understand first why it works and second how to create your own. </p>
 
<p>The world is very complex so we use complex functions that simplify work. Microchips or programming functions are examples. But these functions are made up of small pieces of logic or components that can be learned and understood.</p>
 
<p>The average person does not understand the inner mechanics of these, they only use them in their job in order to multiply their force. 
Think of someone using a vacuum, they don't understand the vacuum but can use it. It isn't cost effective to teach someone how a vacuum works mechanically and physics wise if all they need to do is use it to clean. Though a curious person goes beyond.</p>
   <br>
 <p>-BJT transistors work well for less than <1 amp(Less than). Mosfets for more.
You and use transistors alongside signal or pulse generators to pulse a signal. Plugging the pulse into the middle or base connector will do it(For NPN).</p>
  <br>
 <h4>19/10/24</h4>
 
 <p>-If you live in the same house as others you all share energy to an extent. This physically manifests as the organs and their electrochemicals, fluids, hormones and such.
In practical terms, if someone is grinding then eventually you'll passively feel the effects of that. Similarly if they're wasting away due to depression or drugs, you'll also get hit by it in a way.
This extends to the neighborhood to a lesser extent and town you live in.</p> 
   <br>
 <p>-Raw electronic components build into microchips which then form into computers.</p>
   <br>
 <p>-Old renaissance Italian noble and scholar clothing is awesome. It's such a vibe.</p>
    <br>
 <h4>20/10/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Here's a magic spell for deciding the presidential election candidate. Bet lots of money on the one you don't want to win. They'll loose the election and you'll loose money but the other candidate you want to win will.
As long as the gambling gods don't find out at least.(Postnote – It’s like hanging washing outside to call the rain.)</p>
   <br>
 <p>-We've put young women into the position that young men were meant to fill. They are fragile and stressed creatures who are failing to handle, process and fulfill their given unnatural duties. </p>
   <br>
 <h4>21/10/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Major circuits - Power supply, amplifier, oscillator, filter, logic gate, flip-flop, timer, comparator, rectifier, voltage regular.</p>
   <br>
 <h4>22/10/24</h4>
 
 <p>-An artificial heart might use a pulse generator to set a rhythm and then other pulse related things would come from that. Emotions probably oscillate circuits to some degree so it would transmit and receive frequency.</p>
   <br>
 <p>-Selling raw materials is the most grounded career. It probably doesn't make much but it will always be in need.</p>
   <br>
 <p>-Ghosts may operate at certain bands of the emf spectrum.</p>
   <br>
 <p>-"his device (Delta-T) enables time-traveling. The central part of the device consists of 2 frame antennas that are arranged 90 degree in relationship to each other. Each frame is approximately 2 meters in diameter. The antennas can consist of tubes which are 10 cm in diameter. The tubes must be superconductive. Inside the tubes float liquid helium for the superconductivity. The control device of the machine consists of a sinus generator with a tuning capacity from 1-Hz to 1000-MHz. The signal from this generator is amplified a little before it goes to a phase changer. This changes the phase of the signal 90-degrees. The phase changer is independent of the frequency in. The phase change is 90-degrees for both the 1-Hz and 1000-MHz input. The in-signal is split just before the phase changer so that one part is unchanged and another part is changed 90-degrees. After the phase changer, the signal amplified with 2 linear amplifiers to 100,000 watts on each channel. After that, the 2 channels are fed to its respective frame antenna. The signal on one frame antenna will always be 90-degrees in phase difference to the other frame antenna.</p>
 
<p>Usage:
 
The generator is set to 1-Hz and the machine is turned on. A compass needle at the center of the machine will travel slowly round. Inside and round the antenna system, it becomes a powerful rotating magnetic field. At a higher generator frequency, the magnetic field will rotate faster. Approximately 2 meters from the antennas are placed several chairs arranged in a circle around the antenna system. Here the time travelers are placed.</p>
 
<p>One increases now the generator frequency gradually until the speed of the rotating magnetic field is close to the speed-of-light. If the right conditions are present now (etherical/astral), the time will run slower for those who are sitting on the chairs compared to persons outside the power-field. Seen from the chairs, the time will run normal between each chair. The time travelers' clock will run normal. They will see the clock on the wall outside the power-field running fast into the Future. The nearer the rotating speed of the magnetic field comes to the speed-of-light, the faster will the time travelers move into the future.</p>
 
<p>If the speed of the magnetic field is set equal to the speed-of-light, the time will freeze as seen from outside the magnetic field. As seen from the time travelers view, they are moving endlessly fast into the future (they will not be able to sense the world outside the magnetic field and the time will stop for them). If one increases the frequency further, the rotating speed of the magnetic field will become greater than the speed-of-light. The time sensed from the chairs would then be reversed, and they will see the clock on the wall outside the magnetic field moving backwards. The time travelers will now travel back in time. At the speed-of-light, the time travelers go both endlessly fast into the Future and the Past at the same time.</p>
 
<p>The result is that the time freezes at that speed. At a higher frequency, they will travel slower into the Past. When the speed of the magnetic field approaches the speed-of-light from above, the time travelers will travel faster into the past. At the speed-of-light for the magnetic field rotation, the time is frozen for the people inside the power-field and they can't register anything. For an outside person who looks inside, the power-field it looks like looking at a frozen hologram.</p>
 
<p>If one from outside the magnetic field tries to touch the field at this state, it seems harder than steel. The outside person will at this state not be able to penetrate the power-field which acts as an endlessly strong armor at that state. If one puts a clock inside the power-field, an outside person will observe the following. At 1-Hz, the clock will run normal. When the frequency arrives at the lowest part of the VHF band (above 30-MHz) the clock seems to be going slower. At the top of the VHF band (approximately 300-MHz), the clock will stop completely. In the lower part of the UHF band (from 400-MHz), the clock begin to go slowly backwards. At 1000-MHz, the clock will go approximately at normal speed backwards. It's also possible that the machine must have an injection of modulated orgone energy to function." -Unknown Source.(Postnote – Might be a forum post about the Philadelphia or Montauk experiment.)</p>
   <br>
 <p>-VHF is 30-300 mhz.
Fm is around 70-110mhz.
UHF is 400. (Postnote – Give or take.)</p>
 
   <br>
 <h4>23/10/24</h4>
 
 <p>-You can pulse a motor with a pulse generator. I wonder how well it'd work for vehicles.</p>
   <br>
 <p>-Frequency and pulses in circuits seems to control time. The when things happen and for how long. Amplitude is the amount and frequency is the speed. A waveform is created from these. Lights show us the created cycle and speakers let us hear it.
You connect the signal to the base of a transistor in order to amplify it to power components.</p>
   <br>
 <h4>24/10/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Assumptions on Halloween symbolism -
Halloween is the autumn and or fertility festival. The orange pumpkin symbolises the feminine, the womb or eggs. For metals, Mercury oxide is orange, copper is orange and boosts fertility, it makes a blue ghostly flame. The white of the ghost is the masculine, relating to semen. Lead oxide is white and zinc metal is also related as it helps to generate sperm and makes a green-white ghostly flame.</p>
   <br>
 <p>-Stress seems to cause the body to swell up like a tomato. Certain pathways of the body swell up depending on the type of stress and emotion.</p>
   <br>
 <h4>26/10/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Maybe we could get energy from frequency, attract the energy or something.
Tuning an antenna to "Gods" frequency so to speak.
Either ultra high or ultra low frequency.</p>
 
<p>Maybe that's why it's called "zero point energy". When you hit the point of infinity or nothingness, then there is everythingness.(Postnote – Or Zero point might be the “energy”/force from a vacuum.)</p>
   <br>
 <p>-1 over 2 pi to the square root of L and C is resonant frequency.(Postnote – Look into LC circuits and their formulas to get a better idea of this. RC and LRC circuits too.)</p>
   <br>
 <h4>27/10/24</h4>
 
 <p>-People think technology destroyed society and changed "the good old days" to what we have now. I disagree. I think it was the ruining of social cohesion and morality through “subversive” cultural influences and immigration.</p>
   <br>
 <p>-Ohms law is v = I*R</p>
   <br>
 <p>-I(amperage) = v(voltage) / R(resistance)</p>
<p>I = V/R</p>
<p>V = I*R</p>
<p>R = I/V</p>
   <br>
 <p>-The blacks(Africans) were probably mass produced as slaves. Haiti for example has blacks who were imported I believe. They are not the natives. I imagine the French colonists used them as slaves.</p>
   <br>
 
 <h4>29/10/24</h4>
 
 <p>-Perhaps fermentation volatilizes matter. Raising its state up to a spiritual one.</p>
   <br>
 <p>-Thermoplastic polyurethane.</p>
   <br>
 <p>-TPU for flexible filament.</p>
   <br>
 <p>-Resistors convert voltage to current. By putting them in series you add their resistance value, making a larger resistor. By putting them in parallel you divide 1 by the resistor value and add all values together, creating a smaller resistance value. They can be used to control and limit current.(Postnote – Nowadays I see them as “current invokers” as in, if you put one in a circuit it starts to draw current and add heat to the circuit. It’s like a mini short circuit.)</p>
   <br>
 <h4>30/10/24</h4>
 
 <p>-A wide smile shows the most sadness.</p>
   <br>
 <p>-Life seems to be contradictory and full of opposites. Things are constantly shifting and when you think you've got it figured out, the ground moves from under you. If you can solve this mercurial puzzle box then perhaps it'll lead to the domination of life.</p>
   <br>
 <h4>31/10/24</h4>
 
 <p>-I see people fidgeting in their cars when at a stop on the road a lot. 
I think patience is something that people lack in todays world. Meditation and humility helps to build this.</p>
   <br>
 <p>-For anyone replacing brake pads, full metal or sintered seem to last pretty much forever in my experience. Half metal are okay but have less grip and organic has hardly any grip and wears out quickly. Carbon is just for racing I think.</p>
