<h4>1/2/21</h4>

<p>Nitric oxide might be the old idea of spirit.</p>
<br>

<h4>4/2/21</h4>

<p>Slavery is based on the root, on the home. Those without a house are pseudo slaves. If you house and feed another they are a pseudo slave.</p>
<br>
<p>See things for what they are.</p>
<br>

<h4>5/2/21</h4>

<p>Air has energy in it.</p>
<br>
<p>I think the next technological revolution will be with robots. They'll handle most lower level tasks that we don't want to and eventually humans will more or less live and do their own things in their society or house while robots handle all of the labor and thought tasks.</p>
<br>
<p>Opening as a sheep and ending as a wolf is one way to eat prey.</p>
<br>

<h4>6/2/21</h4>

<p>Respect your own personal space and others. Respect the boundaries of it and others. If others do not respect your space then make them or don't respect theirs.</p>
<br>

<h4>7/2/21</h4>

<p>Fertility is the water to the soil or earth.</p>
<br>
<p>Everything takes 10x more what you thought you need to be successful and then 10x more than that. So 100x harder than the initial thought.</p>
<br>
<p>Places with strong spirits probably have ancestors of the past who continue to watch over areas and guide the people.</p>
<br>
<p>Dollard said he could make a plasma ball or sun in an old street light or glass tube. Apparently it looked like a galaxy when in some kind of field. Amazing eh.</p>
<br>

<h4>8/2/21</h4>

<p>Money rules the physical world.</p>
<br>

<h4>9/2/21</h4>

<p>Materials scientists are able to create many kinds if not any kinds of materials.</p>
<br>

<h4>10/2/21</h4>

<p>Don't do things in stressful postures. This will absorb more stress.</p>
<br>
<p>Picture a sphere in your stomach/ belly and rotate it. Pull in energy while rotating it. This is a good technique.</p>
<br>
<p>Seven elements = Fire, water, wind, earth, sound, light, EM. From densities - Earth, water, wind, fire, sound, light, EM. Assumably.</p>
<br>
<p>Talismans have spells cast onto them ahead of time and can be activated at will.</p>
<br>

<h4>11/2/21</h4>

<p>In the past phones were used to order up services or products. Now, the net is used.</p>
<br>

<h4>12/2/21</h4>

<p>Gamble on your own business instead of a casino.</p>
<br>
<p>The idea of gong potency is interesting. Basically that the more you work, the better your work ability is built up.</p>
<br>

<h4>13/2/21</h4>

<p>Sometimes letting the natural energies move in their own way is good.</p>
<br>
<p>Hold a tournament to get tournament like people. Like in this way attracts like.</p>
<br>
<p>Low grade pills are basic ones like digestion or appetite pills, basic pain killers and anti inflammatory. Usually with 1-3 herbs. Also the grade of the herb can change the grade of the medicine. I wonder if roasting herbs or heating them while in their physical form will aid in making of pills, maybe with the use of some water or vinegar or wine. Even alkali as well.</p>
<br>

<h4>14/2/21</h4>

<p>Put energy into the head to enhance mental strength.</p>
<br>

<h4>15/2/21</h4>

<p>I wonder if internal energy is nervous system energy while muscular is more physical or external energy.
This would make quick moves more internally related while slow is external.</p>
<br>
<p>Smell dominant beings are anal or root dominant.</p>
<br>

<h4>16/2/21</h4>

<p>-The gods are like puppet masters who control strings which direct us, except these gods are simply forces of nature, different emotions, thoughts or the elemental archetypes hidden behind these.</p>

<p>If one can get others to pray upon them then they gain strength and power. This is how digital presences or people online and celebrities gain so much strength, money and energy.</p>
<br>

<h4>17/2/21</h4>

<p>Root pains and problems means an unsupportive environment, one which does not give you resources and energy, health and love.
People grow up malnourished if this is in pain.</p>
<br>
<p>Stop caring about others, this is how to beat social anxiety.</p>
<br>
<p>Magic - thought and feeling, think and feel what you want to happen.</p>
<br>

<h4>18/2/21</h4>

<p>Life force can come from pleasure.</p>
<br>
<p>Once the nervous system is receptive enough it can probably pick up electromagnetic radiation, frequency, etc. This would explain psychic effects being in this realm. Also that psychedelic drugs enhance the nervous system, the brain and mind, imagination. I believe being on the internet enhances our nervous system or is a nervous system tool so to speak.</p>
<br>
<p>A good lesson is that revenge makes things right.</p>
<br>
<p>Education seems to take vital energy and force the brain to develop.</p>
<br>

<h4>19/2/21</h4>

<p>I imagine once people get bored of corona virus as their entertainment then things will change. lol.</p>
<br>
<p>Saturn is to follow the rules, societies rules and structures, Uranus is to break them, to make your own.
To have a business you need Saturnian energy, this is your grounded, day by day societal energy. Uranian people are more like artists.</p>
<br>
<p>The world naturally follows whoevers natural force is the strongest.</p>
<br>
<p>I think giving computers a magnetic field would give them a heart or emotional faculties.</p>
<br>
<p>If people want to put their consciousness in robots then the robot needs to be able to house consciousness as a fundamental. Unless of course someone performs a brain and maybe spine and nerve transplant.</p>
<br>

<h4>20/2/21</h4>

<p>As long as you're strong you can handle the world.</p>
<br>
<p>The kidneys are the root of immortality and health.</p>
<br>
<p>Gaining Saturnian power gives dominion over people, the world, society, animals, nature. Uranian power is more internet power, creativity.</p>
<br>
<p>I think the nervous system is the magic cable or channel device. We can send electricity through this nervous system or probably use magic through it.</p>
<br>
<p>I wonder if bismuth can enhance the magic powers of the body.</p>
<br>
<p>I think inducing magnetic fields around or in crystals is the best way to enhance their power.</p>
<br>
<p>I imagine that larger EM waves get stopped by buildings, people or physical things. While the smaller they get the more they can penetrate. It's as if size is a dimension. I imagine EM waves is subtle force/pressure.</p>
<br>
<p>Pisces is so much fun, everyone seems like they're nuts and it's all entertainment to me.</p>
<br>

<h4>21/2/21</h4>

<p>It's about pressure.</p>
<br>
<p>Stabilize the crown to hear your own thoughts.</p>
<br>
<p>Negative and positive like John Chang said, perineum negative and lower belly positive.</p>
<br>
<p>We need to write limits on government.</p>
<br>

<h4>22/2/21</h4>

<p>I don't get this non duality nonsense. There exists up and down, male and female, so how does it not exist?</p>
<br>
<p>When I lay on the left side I become hot and when I lay on the left I become cool.</p>
<br>
<p>Apparently certain objects can resonate aether energy into electricity. I'm not sure if they're resonated with radio equipment or naturally do when hung in the air.</p>
<br>
<h4>23/2/21</h4>

<p>Sometimes instead of focusing in my body I can focus on doing the task at hand.</p>
<br>
<p>Apparently ankles relate to kidneys.</p>
<br>
<p>Anyone with any integrity wont use things against you. If they do that shows they have a poor character.</p>
<br>
<p>The greenness of a ghost might be due to zinc or copper salts.</p>
<br>
<p>With deplatforming the world split into heaven and hell. Twitter, youtube, facebook being heaven and bitchute, gab, being hell.</p>
<br>
<p>The irony or poetry is that heaven is the true hell and hell is the true heaven.</p>
<br>
<p>The yin and yang of animals, their flesh and blood.</p>
<br>
<p>The blood is first drained so that it does not rot inside of the animal. Otherwise it needs to be chilled.</p>
<br>
<p>Exercise is an expenditure of energy. Strength work uses more energy in a short rep or action while endurance uses less over a longer period of time.</p>
<br>
<p>Just because our brain processes sight or senses in data does not mean that reality is data. It's just a processing language.</p>
<br>
<p>Whoever modulates your emotions controls you. They're sending out a signal to you which controls you.</p>
<br>
<p>Frequency is the language like how words or language is the language but objects, places, concepts, etc are the solid things or reality.</p>
<br>

<h4>24/2/21</h4>

<p>Killing intent is the intent to kill, a killing strike is that which is a strike which intends to kill.</p>
<br>
<p>Breathing the same air as others causes a merging. Or so to speak, if someone exhales in a space that you're in, you're liable to breathing that air, taking on whatever they are or have, their poisons, etc.</p>
<br>
<p>Physical form is kind of like a cymatic bio pattern. A frequency in the background which dictates the matter which is the body, how it grows, what elements its made from.</p>
<br>
<p>Building an intense focus on an object might be a good practice for magic.</p>
<br>
<p>Liver and oysters, both good physique building foods.</p>
<br>

<h4>25/2/21</h4>

<p>Ivy makes my hands super smooth. I think lacquer could work as a good hand cream.</p>
<br>
<p>A basic rpg potion would be some boiled herbal powders or a basic herbal extraction.</p>
<br>
<p>I wonder if the trace gasses found in the air can be breathed in in small amounts and can be breathed in more with proper qi gong or breathing techniques. Slow, meditative breathing. This might be why there's that highness when you continuously inhale.</p>
<br>
<p>To cultivate the soul force, focus around the heart.</p>
<br>
<p>I imagine the heart is the regular soul and the head is the divine soul maybe. Focusing and filling the heart energy makes me feel like I have more of a glow, more spiritual energies. Almost like electricity or a form of magnetic glow. When the energy fills the head it makes the eyes light and glow.</p>
<br>
<p>We live in the world of things or objects in this era. A good piece of tech or an object can make a difference.</p>
<br>

<h4>26/2/21</h4>

<p>Make mental beings out of polygons or simple geometry.</p>
<br>
<p>We're entering a critical mass of stupidity and fear.</p>
<br>
<p>Yells and shocks, slamming tables and the ground is a nervous system attack.</p>
<br>
<p>Dissolve the center in the mind.</p>
<br>

<h4>27/2/21</h4>

<p>Puberty blockers seem to block the earth and water veins which relate to fertility and growth. Not good.</p>
<br>
<p>The spirit is within the head/brain.</p>
<br>
<p>Milk ducts look like seminal ducts.</p>
<br>
<p>I wouldn't mind getting a boat and sailing around.</p>
<br>
<p>We're all leeches sucking at others until we can make something of ourselves.</p>
<br>
<p>You can think of the chest and back as being connected to the shoulders like a ring around the body. This is the manliness ring.</p>
<br>
<p>-There is the world of energy and the world of reality and that of man or society. Videogames, manga, anime and online image boards provided a childhood and adolescence for those who couldn't have one. They were only symbolic representations, false experiences like a dream is to reality, but freeer in a sense, more translucent.</p>

<p>The children who grew up with these, some of them moved on, but some didn't and kept their symbolic representations of reality, of relationships, experiences and life. Some even moved on to creating these in the form of games or art.</p>
<br>

</h4>28/2/21</h4>

<p>The image about walking into certain cities and their electromagnetic radiation along with nanobots restructuring you to be a part of that city is becoming more real than ever.</p>
<br>
<p>The genitals are the flower of the body, sex the sweetness of life.</p>
<br>
<p>All things have their earthly bodies but divine heads or parts.</p>
<br>
<p>Immune system disorders and aids relates to the root or anus which is the shielding layer of the body. Those who suffer from aids cannot protect themselves from disease or bad energy.</p>
<br>
<p>Wealth attracts more wealth.</p>
<br>
<p>The new world empire will be within the sky, an internet based one.</p>
<br>
<p>Blood and hormones, yin and yang. Physical liquid of life and volatile essences of life.</p>
<br>
<p>The belly or abdominal has two main parts with two sections, both left and right. First is the inner abdominal region and second is the outer oblique. These narrow and form a triangle downward at the genital region and the hip or glute and leg connects to the oblique area.</p>
