<h4>3/5/21</h4>

<p>-The royal family is like the government. It is not all powerful, just simply a great and strong family or corporation which has a lot of power. Kind of like the sun or Saturn. Other corporations are like stars and planets in the sky, they have their own great power as well and force.</p>

<p>All of these entities rein down power upon the peasants but none truly control them so to speak. As in you can override their power and go your own way. Perhaps the government seems to have the most power because they are closest to matter, to reality or Saturn.</p>
<br>
<p>There is an abdominal girdle which protects the guts.</p>
<br>
<p>Iron shirt is more like iron leotard but it's the muscular layer which protects the whole torso, groin and chest.</p>
<br>
<h4>4/5/21</h4>

<p>Strength of the genitals comes from the root or legs.</p>
<br>
<p>I wonder if the womb is the inner point of the root or sacral.</p>
<br>
<p>It might be possible to activate animals intelligence by neural brain stimulation.</p>
<br>
<p>Mountains hold ores and gems.</p>
<br>
<h4>5/5/21</h4>

<p>Physical/body level, energy/vital level, mental/divine level, immortal/void level.</p>
<br>
<h4>6/5/21</h4>

<p>Fragrance powder - a powder base like talc or starches with essential oils imbued into it.</p>
<br>
<h4>8/5/21</h4>

<p>-There are two energies, tension and relaxation. Tension is more physical while relaxation energy is a more subtle, watery or airy kind of force opposed to tension which is more like earth and fire. Intense tension is like fire. Light relaxation feels more like water while intense relaxation feels like air.</p>

<p>So then hp potions would restore the tension while mana pots restore the relaxation energy. I think sugary things restore the relaxation energy while salty stuff restores the tension energy. I imagine magic uses all of these forces, projected out of the body.</p>
<br>
<h4>9/5/21</h4>

<p>Maybe that shooting star was actually a spirit in the sky.</p>
<br>
<h4>11/5/21</h4>

<p>Breathing is good to gain spirit.</p>
<br>
<h4>12/5/21</h4>

<p>Supposedly money is related to the root.</p>
<br>
<h4>13/5/21</h4>

<p>Head of gold, chest and arms of silver, belly and genitals to butt bronze or copper and thighs/calves of iron. Feet of iron and clay. The head is where the god of man is in. King and priest is the sun and moon in the head.</p>
<br>
<p>Quartz seems to have some kind of magical property.</p>
<br>
<h4>15/5/21</h4>

<p>To gain immortality and strong vitality, fix the kidneys.</p>
<br>
<p>The bones supposedly are where the toxins are held.</p>
<br>
<p>It is the cold yin energy which allows for relaxation.</p>
<br>
<h4>16/5/21</h4>

<p>Bone cleaning cultivation - 1. Focus on the bones and radiate them with your mental power. 2. Breathe into them. 3. Focus and pull into them. 4. Tense the muscle and pressure them physically.</p>
<br>
<h4>17/5/21</h4>

<p>Fertilizer is made from waste. The nitrogen crystallizes and fertilizes land. Something like that.</p>
<br>
<h4>18/5/21</h4>

<p>A woman becomes a woman by having a baby. A man becomes a man by slaying a beast or another man. I wonder what modern slaying beasts is. Maybe slaying great internal demons might be it. That might be why men love games where we kill.</p>
<br>
<p>The opposite of giving life is taking it.</p>
<br>
<p>Alchemy is the study of matter, physical reality and how to transmute and reform it.</p>
<br>
<h4>19/5/21</h4>

<p>Astragalus seems to be used to stimulate breast milk. I imagine cause it enhances qi and fluids.</p>
<br>
<h4>22/5/21</h4>

<p>Magic is using mental power to control that which is below it. Using a higher force.</p>
<br>
<p>The moon restores mana. Silver potions are mp potions.</p>
<br>
<h4>24/5/21</h4>

<p>Chili gives a lot of yang energy.</p>
<br>
<p>Flour and water makes sauce.</p>
<br>
<h4>25/5/21</h4>

<p>Maybe the female prostate equivalent is the womb. The place of life.</p>
<br>
<p>The money is in the land or the space. Farming is how to draw money from the land. I need to find out how to draw that out of the internet. Online investing is one way. Crypto mining is another.</p>
<br>
<p>Relax your mind and allow the upper room of heaven to open up. This is the dao, god, the light. The feet will energise allowing you to become humble.</p>
<br>
<h4>26/5/21</h4>

<p>Mens sexual energy is based on heat and vigour(heat?) while womens is more based on fluid seemingly.</p>
<br>
<h4>27/5/21</h4>

<p>To make an oil of something, heat it down in water and thicken the liquid.</p>
<br>
<h4>28/5/21</h4>

<p>Mugwort warms the womb.</p>
<br>
<h4>29/5/21</h4>

<p>Magnetic healing opens up the locked areas of energy.</p>
<br>
<p>The jin dan, golden egg or pearl, 金蛋.</p>
<br>
<p>To mix things alchemically, first refine them into their purer parts.</p>
<br>
<h4>31/5/21</h4>

<p>I imagine women with big boobs have strong and large ovaries. High estrogen means big boobs, high progesterone means big milk ducts.</p>
