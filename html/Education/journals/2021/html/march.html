<h4>1/3/21</h4>

<p>Steel your nerves to survive vocal attacks.</p>
<br>
<p>I wonder if everyone has a different chakra of which they're native to.</p>
<br>
<p>A physical action, even a small one will generally garner more attention than loud words in the right situation.</p>
<br>

<h4>2/3/21</h4>

<p>We're in a feminine age where hierarchy and structure is breaking down.</p>
<br>
<p>There is a girdle around the lower belly that encompasses the bladder region and hips. This is the lower girdle.</p>
<br>
<p>If people become robotic and destroy their own world then they wont be able to evolve anymore and will have to feed off another planet for life.</p>
<br>

<h4>4/3/21</h4>

<p>You can't teach by force or by taking something away.</p>
<br>
<p>If you show strength, retain strength and be strong then you will be given it back from others.</p>
<br>
<p>Others who succumb to woke culture by showing weakness then get the wrath of the internet or society for showing that weakness, they get eaten alive.</p>
<br>
<p>Maybe making virtual animals would be a good precursor to virtual humans. Programming movement patterns, daily life, personality, interests, interactions, etc.</p>
<br>
<p>Magical thinking is when you break everything into that of a game. Status effects are a major point. Tiredness for example, anxiety, joy, refreshedness, overheated, cold, etc are all status effects of varying degrees and types.</p>
<br>

<h4>5/3/21</h4>

<p>Be careful of the cycles and patterns.</p>
<br>
<p>The virtual world is the best.</p>
<br>
<p>Those who don't cast shadows may be ghosts.</p>
<br>
<p>Seemingly a lot of writers started by writing on forums and then moved to blogging and then a book.</p>
<br>
<p>The manipura is the power center.</p>
<br>
<p>I now understand the red and gold colors of a king, of complete power.</p>
<br>
<p>Cinnabar seems to open up the mind center.</p>
<br>

<h4>6/3/21</h4>

<p>Angels reside in heaven, birds reside in the sky. Bugs in the earth or hell.</p>
<br>
<p>Seems like kimono fabric was a kind of rare item or even investment of the past. It goes to show that not only stocks and gold are investments.</p>
<br>

<h4>7/3/21</h4>

<p>The cringe energy is a powerful one. Learning it can help with story making.</p>
<br>
<p>I wonder if BTC is only going up now cause we're entering Aquarius but then after it wont be so hot.</p>
<br>
<p>Being in a different location makes a different man.</p>
<br>
<p>Water absorbs radio waves, these are lower frequencies and the water is related to lower elemental level.</p>
<br>

<h4>8/3/21</h4>

<p>The mind is a little like a plasma TV where things can get stuck in or on it.</p>
<br>
<p>Think of yourself like a stock. Others are trying to short you so why not go long.</p>
<br>
<p>We live in an age of infinite leverage.</p>
<br>
<p>Millenials are starting to get old lol.</p>
<br>

<h4>9/3/21</h4>

<p>Piss to clear the emotions.</p>
<br>
<p>Sexuality, water, women , this is all the rest while work is masculine, fire, energy.</p>
<br>

<h4>10/3/21</h4>

<p>People who are overly non judgmental are a little bit unnerving.</p>
<br>
<p>Electricity is kind of like intense fire.</p>
<br>
<p>I wonder how it relates to fire as fire is usually a volatile oil burning. I wonder if electricity is a volatile that is so subtle or something which then combusts in air at high power or pressures.</p>
<br>
<p>I think the crown holds the authority of a king. It's different than raw power but like a form of directed and controlled force.</p>
<br>
<p>The qi is within the naval, it is a heat. You can circulate it through the body from this spot by pulling it out.</p>
<br>
<p>Using qi for martial arts. Gather qi in the body then in a limb or hand, foot. Strike.</p>
<br>
<p>The energy ball technique cultivation has made it so that I can easily project energy out of my hands.</p>
<br>
<p>Find peace in the moment instead of always trying to force yourself forward. This will allow the yin to build and to stabilize.</p>
<br>

<h4>11/3/21</h4>

<p>A way to learn things. Submerge your mind in educational material, dive into the work and do an easy project. Do it again and again until you really understand and the skill becomes muscle memory.</p>
<br>

<h4>12/3/21</h4>

<p>There are always going to be people who disagree with you. So instead of considering all sides or wondering, be confident in your position.</p>
<br>
<p>Opening up the cv-3 point helps the bladder.</p>
<br>
<p>Transport with skylines would be super fast, like small trains in the air. A spider showed me that on its web.</p>
<br>
<p>I imagine that it's possible that there are millions of internal cultivation methods, all fitting different people and can aid them go past their issues and become better, stronger people.</p>
<br>
<p>I wish we still had clans, they're kinda like giant families.</p>
<br>

<h4>13/3/21</h4>

<p>I wonder if the color of some fruits, vegetables, seeds, etc relate to mineral colors like pumpkin seeds being dark green relating to iron.</p>
<br>
<p>I think in astrology that mars is the police and mars has been squaring a lot of planets for quite a while.</p>
<br>
<p>Eventually we'll enter virtual worlds and conquer those, or space. Then things'll become a bit free again like before the whole world seemed to be built.</p>
<br>
<p>I want the command prompt to life. Maybe quantum computing and magic can do it.</p>
<br>

<h4>14/3/21</h4>

<p>"truth is the virus cant spread, its a process we all go through to detox , trigger by the season etc.... more toxic you take in, the more you get sick and more intense it can be"-Unknown So basically seasonal changes can trigger this. Stress too.</p>
<br>
<p>A small start starts anything. We all want to assume that everything happens with a big bang, not always.</p>
<br>
<p>Each program is kinda like a new hyper reality. A game is a step deeper than a web browser which is a step deeper than just the desktop or this notepad which fits in between them.</p>
<br>
<p>The weight of Saturn is the crown. Heavy is the head which wears the crown. This is society and law, restriction.</p>
<br>
<p>I imagine with androids their programming will slowly degrade along with their hardware physical parts. Also the programming loops will save junk stuff in the memory and they'll enter bad cycles like a human entering bad thoughts of anxiety. Good programming and good environments can probably help to reduce these negative influences though.</p>
<br>

<h4>15/3/21</h4>

<p>The “hells” are in the leg. The feet and knees are each one, in between them are three and above are three and I think the main is in the genital anus area, Or that is the first and gateway to hell. Some see 9 hells, others see 7.</p>
<br>
<p>Crystal technology.</p>
<br>
<p>Maybe start by talking about the main point, then talk about other relating things.</p>
<br>
<p>Taurus is the mouth.</p>
<br>

<h4>16/3/21</h4>

<p>Don't let society hustle you.</p>
<br>
<p>Vaccines are human experimentation.</p>
<br>
<p>Keep grinding every day, you'll get yours, things'll happen. Rest is still important though.</p>
<br>
<p>I think the pineal gland might be kinda like an oscillator making white noise that gets shaped into either what exists inside in the imagination or outside in physical reality.</p>
<br>
<p>Apparently the pituitary can be effected by odor or smell.</p>
<br>
<p>Mix potash and calcium oxide to make calcium hydroxide, then alcohol to make alkahest.</p>
<br>
<p>Everyone will love and want to know you when you've already done all the work and earned your skills, paved your path.</p>
<br>
<p>Be direct. Get to the heart of the manner.</p>
<br>

<h4>17/3/21</h4>

<p>Apparently college kids don't know how to do something without being told or taught while kids who didn't go can figure out stuff on their own.</p>
<br>
<p>The modern worlds old people are eating the youngs root. This is happening through housing prices and taxes.</p>
<br>
<p>Every time you are near, hear, see, think, smell or some other sense at or with others then you take on their thoughts, life and energy.</p>
<br>
<p>Learn to navigate the digital world.</p>
<br>

<h4>18/3/21</h4>

<p>Perhaps one becomes an immortal when the root is fully cultivated.</p>
<br>
<p>The lat seems to be a mid back muscle while the teres group is middle and shoulder is upper.</p>
<br>
<p>If I can make a vacuum chamber dry distiller that'd really do well.</p>
<br>

<h4>19/3/21</h4>

<p>Electricity can move the wind or air ionicly. I guess this is how magic moves the air.</p>
<br>
<p>Probably all the elements have some kind of electromagnetic way of moving, changing, etc.</p>
<br>
<p>Put your foot down in life, especially business and relations or you will be taken advantage of.</p>
<br>
<p>People higher in stress produce less sex hormones.</p>
<br>
<p>Making money online needs two things 1. An audience 2. A product. You don't need to own the product too. Find a way to insert yourself in between already happening transactions. This is the basics of merchantry and trade.</p>
<br>

<h4>20/3/21</h4>

<p>I imagine that music is the air element, drawing is the fire element, modeling is the earth and maybe programming is the electrical. I wonder what water is. Story perhaps.</p>
<br>
<p>Energy stems from a persons driving force.</p>
<br>
<p>Being able to convert energy into items. That will be the future.</p>
<br>

<h4>21/3/21</h4>

<p>-Force release is created by an entire jolt of the body. Usually the lower abdomen is tensed in a quick, twitch manner with an exhale.
Counteracting body movements are also used where you may strike your hand forward but move the body backwards. Similarly when pulling forward you push the body backwards.</p>

<p>When striking, all power comes more or less from the lower abdomen area and the legs which ground and aid in the jolt. Relaxing your body while still keeping control in it until you strike and use tension.</p>
<br>
<p>Very similar to lifting heavy weights above your head in a clean and jerk olympic lift motion.</p>
<br>
<p>Living in space is very pure while living in the deep underground is the darkest, most demonic place. The earthy air would toughen your body and darken you.</p>
<br>
<p>Qi cultivation irl. Gather enough cash to put a deposit on a house is qi gathering stage. Foundations establishment is buying a house or paying it off.</p>
<br>
<p>With the housing price and debt scam the younger generations have been made into slaves.</p>
<br>
<p>The weak, young and poor are slaves in this world.</p>
<br>
<p>What if all these red pill guys are actually all a bunch of wifeless, childless losers who sell overpriced courses online targeting mens insecurities?</p>
<br>

<h4>22/3/21</h4>

<p>-I can use planets, elements and zodiac to sort things algyrythmicly. Then apply types like, "this effects the mind, personality, etc. It interacts with these things or is in this category of food or body part, etc."</p>
<br>
<p>Each level of dimension has it's own art, technique, science, method. Water is one level, physicality is another, then air, etc.</p>
<br>
<p>Well produced shit is still shit.</p>
<br>

<h4>23/3/21</h4>

<p>The yin is the sexual fluids and bottom reservoirs of the body.</p>
<br>
<p>I wonder if the air converts to plasma from electromagnetism cause It's being raised in level, one higher.</p>
<br>
<p>"Some of the blood, however, is also concocted further into semen. This, of course, only happens in the male. The female, according to Aristotle, does not posses enough vital heat to concoct semen. And when the semen comes together with the female menses, the semen concocts the matter of the menses into a heart" -unknown, quote about Aristotle's philosophy.</p>
<br>
<p>Aristotle uses a lot of logic. If an animal eats, it shits, if it sleeps, it wakes, if it walks, it stops, etc.</p>
<br>

<h4>24/3/21</h4>

<p>Don't be afraid to make enemies, else others wont be afraid to make you theirs.</p>
<br>
<p>I believe that spiritual enlightenment is when the mind, brain, mid head starts to become enlivened.</p>
<br>
<p>I wonder how heat is connected to electricity. It seems to heat things up. I wonder if plasma is just hyper heat in atmosphere.</p>
<br>
<p>I'm finding that as my intelligence improves I'm able to understand advanced subjects like science more easily than before, or that they are opening up to being a reality of my comprehension.</p>
<br>
<p>If no one's coming to save you then no one's coming to judge you.</p>
<br>

<h4>25/3/21</h4>

<p>When you're falling off you're falling off. There ain't no lesson in it other than what you learn.</p>
<br>
<p>Qi is air.</p>
<br>
<p>When you disdain society and the world you start to create and enter into your own reality. Creating things as you see fit.</p>
<br>
<p>Boredom and poverty make you do bad shit.</p>
<br>
<p>Magic is mental control, or energy control to an extent. Technique is control of the body or physical stuff. So it's physical-spiritual.</p>
<br>
<p>Good skills turn nothing into something, ideas into reality.</p>
<br>

<h4>26/3/21</h4>

<p>Magic arrow or missile. A mental or magical construct, a point or dot that you shoot off. A shot of will.</p>
<br>
<p>Crystals are just the pure condensed essences of things.</p>
<br>
<p>Being obstinate and stubborn will stop most people who're passive. Being aggressive will stop the rest.</p>
<br>
<p>"For the Taoist practitioner, the body is truly the laboratory of the spirit ."-unknown. Internal alchemy is quite literally transmuting or turning one body fluid into another.</p>
<br>

<h4>27/3/21</h4>

<p>Always keep your mind open for new ways to make money.</p>
<br>
<p>When you read something new and don't understand anything, that is fine. It's because everything is new. Seek to soak up all of that information and build a wide web of everything in that field.</p>
<br>
<p>Programming is a modern skill that's very useful. Video editing is another. What are others? Writing and speaking I guess, mathematics too are some of the basics.</p>
<br>
<p>I think tinctures are like magic potions of old.</p>
<br>
<p>The head is like the end of a match, the glowing end.</p>
<br>

<h4>28/3/21</h4>

<p>Plasma ball dildos.</p>
<br>
<p>The head is more solid and tensed while the jaw or lower area is more relaxed and movable.</p>
<br>
<p>Stop fearing making enemies or making people not like you. Accept who you do and don't like. It's okay to not like some people.</p>
<br>
<p>Learn to see red flags with people and don't be shy about leaving, asking questions and whatever else you need to feel comfortable.</p>
<br>
<p>I think refined body stage is building up muscle and strengthening your body.</p>
<br>
<p>I can't deny my lust for the maid instead of the princess.</p>
<br>
<p>Oxygen lances are awesome.</p>
<br>

<h4>29/3/21</h4>

<p>Don't fear growth. Instead of tensing at the thought, allow yourself to expand and grow properly.</p>
<br>
<p>Too much circulation makes the price go down.</p>
<br>
<p>Focusing in my heart can help to clear thoughts of others.</p>
<br>
<p>Some peoples technique to winning is to be so annoying that no one wants to deal with the situation.</p>
<br>
<p>To feel a stone or items strength, use your internal energy, circulate it a little.</p>
<br>
<p>Excessive training/work makes you temporarily infertile.</p>
<br>

<h4>30/3/21</h4>

<p>Pistols are like knives, shotguns like clubs, snipers are spears, rifles are swords. Guns are similar archetypally to modern weapons.</p>
<br>

<h4>31/3/21</h4>

<p>Androgen increases arousal levels. Anti androgen decreases them.</p>
<br>
<p>Make making money a daily ritual.</p>
<br>
<p>Sugar is a thing which turns into heat or life energy.</p>
