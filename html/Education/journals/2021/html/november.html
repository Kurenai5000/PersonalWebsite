<h4>1/11/21</h4>

<p>The gut is like a power engine, more like a fusion power generator where it captures the orb of the gut and powers from it and gives to it. Then other parts of the body can draw power from it.</p>
<br>
<p>Maybe crystals could act as fertilizer.</p>
<br>
<h4>4/11/21</h4>

<p>Doctors should teach people health, not just treat them.</p>
<br>
<h4>5/11/21</h4>

<p>I think adding the tea or juices of something with its refined salt could make a crude philosophers stone.</p>
<br>
<h4>6/11/21</h4>

<p>Grow some balls and stand up to anyone trying to hustle or threaten you.</p>
<br>
<h4>7/11/21</h4>

<p>Gold is used to make good elixirs.</p>
<br>
<h4>9/11/21</h4>

<p>Bone cleansing powder would use mandrake, ginseng or ginger and horsetail grass. Be careful shitting your guts out though.</p>
<br>
<h4>10/11/21</h4>

<p>I think wherever there is continuous focus is where you grow. In the body it is where blood always pools to.</p>
<br>
<p>I think most workers have nothing better going on in their lives and just get comfortable with having a job, never experimenting or taking the hard road. A job also sucks and is a kind of death, it's like resigning yourself as a robot to the machine of reality.</p> 
<br>
<h4>11/11/21</h4>

<p>Sleeping on the right side sends energy down and heals the body. Left sends it up and stimulates the mind.</p>
<br>
<p>Spicy stuff gets rid of sicknesses pretty quickly.</p>
<br>
<h4>12/10/21</h4>

<p>Comfort and peace can breed degeneracy.</p>
<br>
<p>Rainy days are good to tap into the past.</p>
<br>
<p>I think to make video games you need to look to old games. They seem to have great programming and just lack modern art assets. Modern games are way more simple and lack value from this.</p>
<br>
<p>Alchemy has both separating things but also mixing them together.</p>
<br>
<h4>16/11/21</h4>

<p>Countries are a corporation. Technically that means they have no power over anyone, the cops have no power, judges, prisons or governors.</p>
<br>
<h4>17/11/21</h4>

<p>Put something in the water supply, the air and the food supply to get it into people.</p>
<br>
<h4>18/11/21</h4>

<p>The solid and subtle separated. That's how the world was formed potentially. The dense formed into earth and then generated into minerals while the subtle formed the heavens or sky.</p>
<br>
<p>I think chicken pox might be a reaction to vaccines. Why does every kid get this weird ass illness?</p>
<br>
<h4>19/11/21</h4>

<p>This is the age of leverage. With enough leverage you can make 1 person into 100 or 1000 or a million.</p>
<br>
<h4>20/11/21</h4>

<p>So it seems that there is tons of woke nonsense in corporate jobs and you slowly get indoctrinated if you aren't smart enough or strong enough to resist it.</p>
<br>
<p>What if earth is just a big loosh farm for demons the same way it's a money farm for **** and labour farm for bosses.</p>
<br>
<p>Maybe investing in gold is the way to go to beat inflation.</p>
<br>
<h4>21/11/21</h4>

<p>I think the whole covid scamdemic is a problem of the 5g. Radiation caused low oxygen which gave people breathing issues and now the magnetically charged vax is giving people heart issues. Similarly anti parasitics are medicine for it, cause in low oxygen environments parasites form.</p>
<br>
<h4>23/11/21</h4>

<p>Priests exorcise people of demons by bringing up their stored emotions, it is shadow work.</p>
<br>
<p>"Hustle harder than a crackhead.".</p>
<br>
<p>It seems that the majority of people are either stupid and controlled or smart and controlled. Hence why the covid agenda has become so strong.</p>
<br>
<p>Salt is born of the sun and the sea.</p>
<br>
<h4>24/11/21</h4>

<p>Learn to control your adrenaline so that other's can't control it for you.</p>
<br>
<p>Desert, psychedelic rock is warm music. Electronic is cold music.</p>
<br>
<h4>25/11/21</h4>

<p>Modern science is not interested in consciousness because it's just trying to put reality into math, theories, equations, ideas, etc.</p>
<br>
<h4>26/11/21</h4>

<p>Charity, help, welfare, etc is bad. It makes the recipient weak.</p>
<br>
<p>Saving money is kind of like exercising or studying but for the money.</p>
<br>
<h4>27/11/21</h4>

<p>The reason the young are so black pilled is that they've been born into an exhausted, spent world with no opportunity.</p>
<br>
<h4>29/11/21</h4>

<p>You smash bricks with a jack hammer.</p>
<br>
<h4>30/11/21</h4>

<p>Hormones and electrical signals are the qi field of things. Plants have their own defense hormones, electrical signals, etc just like animals do. Maybe minerals do as well.</p>
