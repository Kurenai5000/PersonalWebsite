<h4>2/9/21</h4>

<p>Virgo season, good for cleaning up, managing life, organising, work with land and dirt.</p>
<br>
<p>Muscles give off electrical discharges when tensed.</p>
<br>
<h4>4/9/21</h4>

<p>Some big youtubers have a weak sense of self.</p>
<br>
<p>The stronger the muscles, the more weight of reality you can hold. </p>
<br>
<p>Reality is ambiently trying to crush and destroy everyone below a certain level. Lucky people don't ever feel this cause they were born well above it. The poor and sick were born below it.</p>
<br>
<h4>5/9/21</h4>

<p>Yahoo japan has a marketplace.</p>
<br>
<p>Get some simple carbs when exhausted, this helps with energy.</p>
<br>
<p>I can search my surroundings using energy.</p>
<br>
<h4>7/9/21</h4>

<p>Mind mix - Ginko, gotu kola, ginseng, bacopa, eyebright, peppermint.</p>
<br>
<h4>9/9/21</h4>

<p>Everything is a process of grinding levels. When practicing something I am grinding in it.</p>
<br>
<h4>11/9/21</h4>

<p>Inner strength lets you go beyond regular speed and torquing of the body. It is what allows masters to destroy physical objects with their hands and feet.</p>
<br>
<p>Use the lower abdominals to activate inner strength. Gathering energy behind the qihai is also good.</p>
<br>
<h4>12/9/21</h4>

<p>He shou is a great root tonic.</p>
<br>
<p>I believe the minds center is the root of magic in the body.</p>
<br>
<p>I wonder if building a giant electro crystal sphere in the air could allow people to use magic. It'd charge them full of magic power. Maybe quartz spheres could do that.</p>
<br>
<p>Quartz is seemingly related to the mind.</p>
<br>
<p>I want to find other ways of electrifying a crystal. Maybe putting it in between two pricks of electricity, a positive and negative. Also using radio waves on them or tesla coils might do something interesting. Maybe making a tesla coil with a crystal at the top. Maybe having a crystal in a strong magnetic field.</p>
<br>
<p>Those antennas on old buildings gathered radiowaves. Electrostatic generators.</p>
<br>
<h4>13/9/21</h4>

<p>Relaxing is the key to generating yin.</p>
<br>
<p>If iron ore is heated outside in air it forms an oxide, a blood red stone. Then if this oxide is heated with no air it forms iron. Usually charcoal is mixed too.<p>
<br>
<h4>14/9/21</h4>

<p>Supposedly electricity attracts and magnetism repels.</p>
<br>
<p>Supposedly the day wilson method uses iodized salt.</p>
<br>
<h4>18/9/21</h4>

<p>I think my solar plexus determines my self confidence.</p>
<br>
<p>People with beautiful heads keep a lot of their energy in the head. I think more intelligent people do that. While others keep it more in body assumably.</p>
<br>
<h4>20/9/21</h4>

<p>Build yourself up from the root. Spend time to solidify the foundation and groundwork.</p>
<br>
<h4>21/9/21</h4>

<p>"herbal preservatives -Rosemary is seen as the top medicinal herb for food preservation. Sage, ginger, cumin seeds, coriander seeds, cinnamon, cloves, garlic, cayenne pepper, fennel seeds, caraway seeds" -Unknown</p>
<br>
<p>Rice and water are all you need to survive, in one way.</p>
<br>
<h4>22/9/21</h4>

<p>The ground is the ground, the heaven is the roof. Then the four elements are the ones infront, behind and to the left and right side of you.</p>
<br>
<p>Tanuki are earth element, fox are fire I believe.</p>
<br>
<p>The imagination is the darkness, I like that one. Maybe then magic is just the imaginary ability, to impose the imagination upon the world.</p>
<br>
<h4>23/9/21</h4>

<p>Setting up a new OS is like setting up a new house I imagine.</p>
<br>
<h4>24/9/21</h4>

<p>I think water in the sink, bladder, bath, shower, etc allows me to listen in to psychic messages, or thoughts which are probably just radio waves.</p>
<br>
<p>Learning programming is basically just like learning language, they're both commanding things with words. They tap into similar parts of me, the mercury part.</p>
<br>
<p>Transistors amplify signals, diodes let it run through one path, resistors control current, caps store electrostatics.</p>
<br>
<h4>25/9/21</h4>

<p>Horse meat is a sexual tonic.</p>
<br>
<p>Smell tells you when the air or something is bad.</p>
<br>
<p>Villages run along rivers and around lakes usually. The back water villages would have less resources and dirtier water, though maybe that grows stronger crops.</p>
<br>
<h4>26/9/21</h4>

<p>Symbolism is related to patterns. Archetypes are common patterns that seem to repeat.</p>
<br>
<p>Three levels, physical, etheric-energetic, astral-mental.</p>
<br>
<h4>27/9/21</h4>

<p>Sleeping head towards north is yang while head towards south is yin. South draws energy down so the north pole is an energy peak.</p>
<br>
<p>It all comes down to self responsibility.</p>
<br>
<h4>28/9/21</h4>

<p>Don't be feeding into your "community" do what you want to create the community.</p>
<br>
<h4>29/9/21</h4>

<p>Flavors are in the middle oils and salts mainly, smells are in the volatile oils.</p>
<br>
<h4>30/9/21</h4>

<p>Yang, helps digestion, helps to sweat, uplifting, inner heating, helps with focus and drive.</p>
<br>
<p>The longer you live in this world the more you start to learn about it. Hence age and experience equals more power in this world.</p>
<br>
<p>Weather and time of day and night are spiritual states. Similarly times of the year and month are all spiritual states.</p>
