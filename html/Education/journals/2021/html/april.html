<h4>1/4/21</h4>

<p>The future of power is instead of money, the ability to draw from millions of peoples spiritual force. I guess it's not always pure power that grants position in life, but position, connections and other fates.</p>
<br>
<h4>2/4/21</h4>

<p>People raging and yelling on internet comments is like a crazy homeless person who you walk past or get away from.</p>
<br>
<p>I can listen to someones opinion without taking it in.</p>
<br>
<p>I need to be careful about watching videos cause they make the things in them feel more normal.</p>
<br>
<p>Debt is like a drug. Everyone is currently high on debt and hoping that hyperinflation happens so they get rid of their cash. But deflation is possible when the high wears off.</p>
<br>
<p>When Saturn enters Aries then things will start to slowly dry up.</p>
<br>
<p>Strength is the foundation of everything.</p>
<br>
<p>Maybe cinnamon is more powerful than I thought. I may need to investigate it more.</p>
<br>
<p>When you use medicinal ingredients enough they become ingrained in you like colors of the rainbow.</p>
<br>
<h4>3/4/21</h4>

<p>The best thing to do is to do the thing. If you can't you're not ready. Train up some more.</p>
<br>
<p>Numbers can be overlayed upon reality to give it values like measuring the circle size and curve lengths of a fry pan, the width, height, depth, etc.
Also you can use them to numerically analyse speed, force, etc.</p>
<br>
<p>Coal and water. The yin and yang of steam engines.</p>

<br>
<h4>4/4/21</h4>

<p>Focusing on the emotions as if things were happening helps to get into dreams.</p>
<br>
<p>Western or first world countries used to be the rich ones. But now that we have a global economy that is not the case.</p>
<br>
<p>Use banks as monetary leverage.</p>
<br>
<p>In this ninja book the first power centre is in the root of the spine. Second is perineum. Third is centre of gravity. Fourth naval. Fifth solar plexus. Sixth behind the throat. Seventh third eye. Eight top of head. 9ths is aura, true enlightenment.</p>
<br>
<p>When you're at the point that you don't care to starve in order to create your work then you're a true artist.</p>
<br>
<h4>5/4/21</h4>

<p>Bonds are issued as a kind of loan for the company issuing it.</p>
<br>
<p>Older people had an external person for everything. Hence why God and Jesus were these external beings they had to tap into.</p>
<br>
<p>If you dwell on the past you're depressed. If you focus on the future, that will make you anxious.</p>
<br>
<h4>6/4/21</h4>

<p>Seems that pearls are some kind of fertility essence cultivation of a shellfish.</p>
<br>
<p>For every 5-10 experiments you get maybe 1 success. Hence always keep that in mind that things may take a few tries sometimes unless you know what you're doing.</p>
<br>
<p>Seems that the idea of vampires, immortality and bats are all related. Maybe alchemists made bat potions to make vampires.</p>
<br>
<p>Accumulations of qi and blood in the body can cause internal heat.</p>
<br>
<p>Don't give into fear or people who scare you. They wont stop if you yield.</p>
<br>
<p>Maybe high heat is like the alchemists equivalent to the electricians high voltage.</p>
<br>
<p>I also need to test out closed alchemical vessels to sublimate. </p>
<br>
<h4>7/4/21</h4>

<p>Eating more helps to grow and aid in extra recovery.</p>
<br>
<p>Seemingly in relationship and gender dynamics, the man is the external while the woman is the internal. So the man is the walls in the example and the woman is what lies within them.The man is the world, the woman is the house.</p>
<br>
<p>The sages power is internal, soft, relaxed, intellectual. The barbarians is that of strength, wildness, harshness, power, bodily development. They're both needed.</p>

<br>
<p>You must learn how to regulate your own emotions.</p>
<br>
<p>My body is my investment, that and my knowledge, my skills.</p>
<br>
<h4>14/4/21</h4>

<p>Relaxed alert state with minimal distraction is good for education.</p>
<br>
<p>Most illness is due to bad energy in the body. An external wound is not counted as an illness in this context.</p>

<p>Back in the day it was slay the dragon or wolf or crocodile and then marry and fuck the village daughter. Nowadays it's more abstract where the dragons or demons are within you or are your life problems. Some are outside of course like a bad boss or shitty persons, but ultimately the game has changed.</p>
<br>
<p>As long as the vital spirit in the body is strong and circulates throughout it, I assume death is impossible.</p>
<br>
<p>Earth power is manipulating weight By manipulating that you control objects and earth. Perhaps by masterful earth magic you can also manipulate and morph the body to enlarge or shrink certain areas.</p>
<br>
<p>I think metallurgy and forging is like herbal concocting.</p>
<br>
<p>Imagine forging a sword out of tons of different rare crystals and ores. What kind of wacky effects would it have? It's like a custom alloy creation.</p>
<br>
<p>Earth - weight. Fire - heat. Water - coldness. Air - movement. I think that might be how these psychic force work.</p>
<br>
<p>Sometimes a person grows because of the position their in. Sometimes because of their status or position they are born already with that body and ability. Though this can lead them to have little actual sense or experience, even if their power is grand.</p>

<br>
<p>Summoning a new god into this plane would be bringing a new planet into this suns orbit.</p>
<br>
<h4>24/4/21</h4>

<p>Wet and moist, gray sky days build up a lot of sexual fluids.</p>
<br>
<p>The masculine energy is the passion, the desire, the movement, the energy to move and be strong.</p>
<br>
<h4>25/4/21</h4>

<p>Fish roe is mainly phosphate. It's good for brain, bone and marrow.</p>
<br>
<h4>27/4/21</h4>

<p>Maybe the enlightened state is that without thought or distractions, without physical hunger, thirst, pain or fatigue. It just is, is natural, is being and existing with consciousness.</p>
<br>
<p>Light, non rich foods can be eaten in large amounts and do not upset the guts. Good for the sick.</p>
<br>
<p>Apparently viruses are just fragments or toxins that the body is getting rid of due to seasonal change or exercise, etc.</p>
<br>
<p>Bad people tear down and attack a weakened member of the team. Good people help bring them back up.</p>
<br>
<p>I think Chinese have figured out how to game the system which is life.</p>
<br>
<p>Focus on back of head to improve memory or to remember stuff.</p>
<br>
<p>The nerves are the power lines to the muscles which are the tension and relaxation vessels. Maybe they're like capacitors.</p>
<br>
<h4>28/4/21</h4>

<p>"Realgar was one of the main minerals used in Taoist alchemy. It was believed to possess the ability to transform copper into gold."</p>
<br>
