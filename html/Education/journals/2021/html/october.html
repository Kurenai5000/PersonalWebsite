<h4>1/10/21</h4>

<p>We die every night.</p>
<br>
<p>Focusing on breath lets me continuously gain power or energy.</p>
<br>
<p>Everything I do costs breath.</p>
<br>
<p>Watching or interacting with other people is exchanges energy.</p>
<br>
<h4>3/10/21</h4>

<p>Maybe when we lost Saturn we lost the power of magic.</p>
<br>
<p>A few can't live in absolute luxury while the rest struggle and live in pain. Eventually the tide will turn.</p>
<br>
<h4>4/10/21</h4>

<p>The higher atmosphere has more power. I imagine sages who live up in the mountains can cultivate high levels of yang electricity. Maybe yang is electricity and yin is magnetism.</p>
<br>
<p>Natural stones that store energy from high up metal resonators.</p>
<br>
<p>"Clean your PC." - The Jordan Peterson tech equivalent.</p>
<br>
<p>The net is inherently yang. Get off the net and into your desktop for a more yin PC experience.</p>
<br>
<p>Try using acetone to extract mineral stuff. It might extract the metallic oil from acetates.<p>
<br>
<h4>6/10/21</h4>

<p>I think Uranus in Taurus might be related to these 80 year cycles of crisis.</p>
<br>
<p>Either way Saturn in Aries seemed to trigger the war and may do again.</p>
<br>
<p>Learn the basics perfectly. Learn a perfect punch, a perfect step, a perfect kick.</p>
<br>
<h4>7/10/21</h4>

<p>Stabilize yourself first before the world.</p>
<br>
<p>I think the world is facing a morality crisis. We need to go forward and regain god, spirituality, morals, etc.</p>
<br>
<p>Allow the ki to flow through your whole body.</p>
<br>
<p>Create imaginary geometry like geometrical pentagrams and such and energize it with energy, see what happens.</p>
<br>
<h4>10/10/21</h4>

<p>I'm starting to think that the spirit roots are the spinal cord/nerves. These allow for spiritual cultivation.</p>
<br>
<p>Never serve a master.</p>
<br>
<h4>12/10/21</h4>

<p>Eat to build the physical body, breathe to build the spiritual body and meditate to build the mental body. There is the body of flesh and bone, of muscles. There is also the spiritual body of pressure and heat. The last one is that of focus and mind.<p>
<br>
<h4>13/10/21</h4>

<p>You can't have a government which taxes its population because then evil people will take over that government and harvest the tax money and power that it has.</p>
<br>
<h4>14/11/2021</h4>

<p>We always have a continuous stream of energy and investing in your own body is a good way to spend it.</p>
<br>
<p>Etheric energy is probably electrical but a more natural form.</p>
<br>
<p>Imprinting or enchanting is charging, using the mind to charge the object with a mental field/intention.</p>
<br>
<h4>14/10/21</h4>

<p>Reading documentation is actually legit. It's a great way to learn software it seems.</p>
<br>
<p>I started seeing ghosts when there was mold. So maybe moldy areas are where people see ghosts. Maybe also mold allows them to manifest.</p>
<br>
<p>Be honest with your emotions and release them in a healthy way.</p>
<br>
<h4>15/10/21</h4>

<p>Maybe the fear of what could happen is worse than the reality of what happens.</p>
<br>
<h4>16/10/21</h4>

<p>The air in this world is so thin. I think from 5g it has become even thinner.</p>
<br>
<h4>17/10/21</h4>

<p>A hypothetical way to invoke rain. Make a bonfire of trees and plants which are water in nature.</p>
<br>
<p>Men can gain status from great deeds, even if the man is young or looks weak.</p>
<br>
<h4>18/10/21</h4>

<p>Extract powders are just alcohol extracts. They don't have the salts which are also important. I'm not sure if the alcohol pulls salts considering you split alcohol from water via salt.</p>
<br>
<h4>21/10/21</h4>

<p>Land/Kingdom/Buildings - Culture/Social customs - Language/Religion</p>
<br>
<h4>22/10/21</h4>

<p>The land expresses out that of the people and the king who rules it.</p>
<br>
<h4>24/10/21</h4>

<p>Maybe the sun going into my astrology houses is not so much that it magically grants me gifts but instead makes me look at those aspects of my life.</p>
<br>
<p>Try imbuing spiritual energy into instruments when playing.</p>
<br>
<p>Socializing is kind of like a program. Activate social program or part of the person. Similarly survival is a program.</p>
<br>
<h4>27/10/21</h4>

<p>Programming is a good analogy to magic cause in magic you need to define everything and how everything works.</p>
<br>
<p>Humans are socialized. This is the middle level. Thoughts are the upper level. Subconscious and perhaps actions is the lower level. When we loose our
socialization then we can revert back to dangerous animalistic ways. These would be the three levels or ways to brainwash people. Control their thoughts, control socializing and then control ability to act or actions.</p>
<br>
<h4>29/10/21</h4>

<p>Women are a volatile stock, men are a slow and steady risers.</p>
<br>
<p>The physical bodies vitality is made strong through it's aura and physical training.</p>
<br>
<p>The law of equivalent exchange is a good one to understand trade.</p>
<br>
<h4>30/10/21</h4>

<p>A house can be divided into three areas. Physical living (food, cleaning, bathing, sleeping, crafting, storing), social (living rooms, dining rooms, meeting rooms), intellectual (offices)</p>
<br>
<p>Alchemy is about reproducing and learning about natural methods of how nature creates and works.</p>
