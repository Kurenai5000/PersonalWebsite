<h4>1/12/21</h4>

<p>Looks like cakes are more or less a way to turn milk products into a solid. Cream, butter, milk.</p>
<br>
<p>Rules are made out of morals. Good quote.</p>
<br>
<h4>5/12/2021</h4>

<p>Matter is a fertile womb for creation. The sky above shines heat and light onto the earth.</p>
<br>
<h4>7/12/21</h4>

<p>Plan out chord progressions with the bass throughout the whole song.</p>
<br>
<h4>8/12/21</h4>

<p>This world only wants the top 1%. It wants people who're already perfect.</p>
<br>
<p>The two modes of living, in society and at home. You can either do everything yourself at your base called home or have others do things in the greater society.</p>
<br>
<h4>10/12/21</h4>

<p>Contemplate matter to manipulate it.</p>
<br>
<h4>12/12/21</h4>

<p>Zen meditation is emptiness. This is perhaps void or earth. Related to both maybe. Maybe void is once you've gone beyond earth.</p>
<br>
<h4>13/12/21</h4>

<p>Perhaps the brain is the aether organ, the 5th mysterious part of the body.</p>
<br>
<p>From mind to matter. Tomorrow is what we thought and acted today so to speak. Hence how to read the future or something like that is to predict the current mental states and emotional states. Also past cycles as a more earthlier way.</p>
<br>
<h4>14/12/21</h4>

<p>Economies start out usually in agriculture and resource harvesting, then move onto manufacturing, then onto financial, big office type stuff.</p>
<br>
<p>Peasant food is porridge and stew.</p>
<br>
<h4>16/12/21</h4>

<p>The soul detaches and enters the darkness after death. Perhaps that void meditation is entering that space of emptiness and void. Perhaps it is an ultimate meditation or start of it, a death and sleep state.</p>
<br>
<p>Don't be different when talking to people or they'll expect you to be that way always. Just be yourself.</p>
<br>
<h4>19/12/21</h4>

<p>Music is of the heart, visual art of the head, perhaps words of the throat and intention of the upper mind or maybe that's atmosphere. Or maybe programming is of the upper mind.</p>
<br>
<p>Prime material is hydrogen, hyle. Maybe it relates to aether or is aether. Perhaps this is the xuan, mysterious darkness. Maybe light is just high frequency air and then electricity is higher frequency light.</p>
<br>
<p>9 hells might be different layers of earth like the dirt level, clay level, rock level, metal level and others.</p>
<br>
<h4>20/12/21</h4>

<p>Building a home looks easier than I thought. They're basically just a solid cement foundation or not, then a wooden frame, bricks on the outer with insulation, dry wall on the inner, then tiling or some kind of roof and dry wall roof with cords going through the wooden frame, plumbing, etc too I imagine.</p>
<br>
<h4>23/12/21</h4>

<p>98% of people still seem to be wearing a mask even two months after the mandates ended. How stupid are the majority of people.</p>
<br>
<p>As long as I keep improving every day and keep training then I'll win in the end.</p>
<br>
<p>-I think that the whole weak men make hard times makes strong men make good times thing is because when the energy goes down then people need to learn to do things again, they need to relearn how to live and work with nature.</p>

<p>So then once they have again created the home, the business, etc and re-created the world after a crash. Then their children have it too good and live in luxury perhaps.</p>
<br>
<p>Curses seem to have their roots in the body related to illnesses. But you can deal with the curse to cure the illness or aid the illness to alleviate the curse.</p>
<br>
<h4>24/12/21</h4>

<p>-Cycle for four seasons - First one develops and invents language, then they teach it to others, then it becomes well used and simple but not well studied and practiced. Eventually people forget how to properly use the language, then it is once again restudied.</p>

<p>Similarly houses are built, people live in them and enjoy themselves, houses break and are fixed, the next generation forgets how to fix that house and it breaks completely.</p>
<br>
<p>Eventually they or their children relearn how to build the house again. Hence the seasons would be 1.Building, 2. Fixed decay, 3. Unfixed decay 4.Destruction or 1.Building, 2. Decay, 3. Destruction, 4. Rebuilding.</p>
<br>
<h4>25/12/21</h4>

<p>Merry Christmas.</p>
<br>
<p>3D printed bodies that people can download new parts for will be the future for those who want to become mechanical.</p>
<br>
<h4>27/12/21</h4>

<p>Talking uses air, exhume more air if your voice is quiet.</p>
<br>
<h4>28/12/21</h4>

<p>-When we outsource survival or necessary tasks to machines like farming and then when we forget natural philosophy - the way that nature works, then society collapses cause the people can't maintain the robots. But probably they figure it out and recreate the robots, skills, etc.</p>

<p>So essentially collapses happen because we neglect the root matters or the basics. So to avoid collapse, always train the basics.</p>
<br>
<h4>29/12/21</h4>

<p>Regular passive meditation is good.</p>
<br>
<p>It does not matter what kanji you learn cause it all makes you better at learning kanji.</p>
<br>
<p>What you're breathing is all of the dust and dirt in a house.</p>
<br>
<h4>30/12/21</h4>

<p>Clean up your house and room to clean up the past.</p>
<br>
<h4>31/12/21</h4>

<p>Temperature is in the air, mostly. Objects can still be cold when the air is hot.</p>
<br>
<p>Speak from the root of yourself.</p>
<br>
<p>I found that energy work sublimates energy into spirit while passive meditation allows it to feed into blood and goes into the lower body.</p>
<br>
<p>Try to wait a few days before making big decisions.</p>
