<h4>1/7/21</h4>

<p>Old alchemy distillers had a bulbous spherical top so that the oil could cool enough to then condense into the next vial.</p>
<br>
<h4>3/7/21</h4>

<p>The cauldron is the belly.</p>
<br>
<h4>4/7/21</h4>

<p>Space or ether magic also relates to long range communication, essentially all things on a PC.</p>
<br>
<p>Computer programs are computer magic. You command the PC to do something in cyber space.</p>
<br>
<h4>5/7/21</h4>

<p>Stone and clay, from the earth build the foundation. Wood from the land builds the walls.</p>
<br>
<p>Willpower is king power or crown power.</p>
<br>
<p>Meteorite iron and nickel are used to make spirit blades. This metal is very yin.</p>
<br>
<p>Zhang Sanfeng is the creator of taiqi chuan. Bodhidharma is a buddhist monk. Apparently they both reached lvl 72 of mopai.</p>
<br>
<h4>6/7/21</h4>

<p>Zinc might be some kind of spiritual mineral.</p>
<br>
<p>Platinum supposedly is related to aether.</p>
<br>
<h4>7/7/21</h4>

<p>Coffee or caffeine has more or less driven the modern world while alcohol drove the past age.</p>
<br>
<p>From Pisces to Aquarius I guess.</p>
<br>
<p>Learn to fight with your mouth and never be afraid of a fight with your hands.</p>
<br>
<h4>9/7/21</h4>

<p>Keep your focus firm within yourself, then it can never be taken by others.</p>
<br>
<h4>10/7/21</h4>

<p>Iron collapses etheric energy.</p>
<br>
<p>Keep investing in yourself to completely secure the future.</p>
<br>
<h4>11/7/21</h4>

<p>Huchison's electromagnetic tech is essentially a magic device. It could be used for magical weapons or to give robots the ability to use magic.</p>
<br>
<p>When talking to others always do it as though you could be being watched or seen. Hence don't overshare anything you don't need to.</p>
<br>
<p>Consciousness is energy and energy is consciousness.</p>
<br>
<p>Breath in and circulate through the meridians.</p>
<br>
<p>"If a martial artist’s meridians were a canal and the dantian was the source of water, then the muscles, skeletons, and organs were the farmland that needed to be irrigated"-Unknown</p>
<br>
<h4>13/7/21</h4>

<p>Water is a flow of energy. Cotton farmers convert the natural water into cotton which then turns into money. So one form of making money is converting land, water and elements.</p>
<br>
<p>Focus in the belly to digest food faster.</p>
<br>
<h4>16/7/21</h4>

<p>Soil and agriculture stuff is really interesting. It seems to be more external alchemy where you can create all kinds of soils and stuff like that.</p>
<br>
<h4>17/7/21</h4>

<p>Nature is the slow world. Society is the quick world.</p>
<br>
<h4>19/7/21</h4>

<p>Mystic is fire, spiritual is air, psychic is water, hylic is earth.</p>
<br>
<h4>20/7/21</h4>

<p>The universe comes through incest.</p>
<br>
<p>Etheric body is the nervous system or energy body the one of feeling and energy. You develop this by doing things mindfully and slowly. Astral body I think is the mental body and maybe etheric is more the life body or the natural ability body.</p>
<br>
<h4>23/7/21</h4>

<p>The four elements are in the chest. Earth in the middle and apparently wood to the left and metal to the right while fire to the top of the heart and water kidneys at the bottom.</p>
<br>
<h4>24/7/21</h4>

<p>The gods of old were personifications of elements, forces, towns, ideas, etc. Eventually they took on enough spiritual power to exist in the imaginary world and even become physical if strong enough. Shamans who used gods to perform ritual and magic would externalize their power through these ideas and then magic would happen through them. Though you don't need a god to perform magic, you are the one performing it.</p>
<br>
<p>Focusing on a certain spiritual centers can over fill it and strain it if you're not careful.</p>
<br>
<h4>25/7/21</h4>

<p>When people are acting really aggressive they're actually weak while if they are calm, they're in their strength.</p>
<br>
<p>Spirit is gained from the heart area but can be stored in the gut. The belly is where the heart fire and bladder water combine. The yin and yang energies.</p>
<br>
<p>-This is the internal alchemy, the forming of the golden centre maybe or elixir. "This concept is that once Yin and Yang have been harmonised for long enough, the body will suddenly enter the xian tian or “pre-heaven” state in which the body suddenly feels a sensation of total circulation of energy in every part. This can also be accompanied by sound, or sudden feelings of surging sensations all through the torso, legs, and head, as well as the arms, hands, and feet.</p>

<p>This state is the true aim of Daoist cultivation as it is the time when the body begins to truly regulate itself and is no longer dependent on outside stimulus delivered to the Central Nervous System. The body is able to relax, and Huang Yuanji called this state, “one hundred meridians flow connected.”</p>
<br>
<p>Wine and alcohol fuels and feeds the bladder yin while cigarettes and stimulants effect the heart yang.</p>
<br>
<p>I think weed is a yin drug, pain killers too.</p>
<br>
<h4>26/7/21</h4>

<p>Websites were big, now apps are the thing.</p>
<br>
<p>We're living in an electromagnetic fish pond. There's always an ambient electromagnetic field cause it is the aether. That means that when people are around they create and tap into this field and create a stronger one. All objects are getting effected by it.</p>
<br>
<p>Paraffin and mercury electrolysis makes gold supposedly.</p>
<br>
<h4>27/7/21</h4>

<p>Flavor travels in the water.</p>
<br>
<h4>28/7/21</h4>

<p>Maybe space is positive and matter is negative.</p>
<br>
<p>Materials costs, shipping costs, tax. Labor costs, transportation costs.</p>
<br>
<h4>29/7/21</h4>

<p>Chili and spices gets the heart going.</p>
<br>
<h4>30/7/21</h4>

<p>You can't get something for nothing.</p>
<br>
<p>The qi gong masters hand trembles when he zaps people. Maybe it's immense energy projection.</p>
<br>
<h4>31/7/21</h4>

<p>Maybe I could sublimate in a big metal pot with a lid.</p>
<br>
<p>Root is the base of power, naval is the holder of power. Mind is the manipulator of power.</p>
<br>
<p>I think orbs are spirits.</p>
