<h4>1/1/2021</h4>

<p>New year, hopefully this one wont be shit.<p/>
<br>
<p>Does metal condense atmosphere into water?</p>
<br>
<p>Instagram is the LA of the net.</p>
<br>

<h4>2/1/2021</h4>

<p>Willpower is mental strength.</p>
<br>
<p>Taichi is a vascular exercise.</p>
<br>

<h4>3/1/21</h4>

<p>People who have full developed bodies are using the whole body in a sparring matches or laboring.</p>
<br>
<p>The body 3d prints organs, hormones, fluids, etc.</p>
<br>
<p>Work is slavery, it's just socially acceptable cause we all still need cash to survive in society.</p>
<br>

<h4>6/1/21</h4>

<p>Spirit channels move spiritual energy that fuels physical components of the body.</p>
<br>

<h4>8/1/21</h4>

<p>Focusing on the tailbone is a good cultivation.</p>
<br>
<h4>9/1/21</h4>

<p>Trump got banned off twitter. The purge is real. Better get ready to check alt tech.</p>
<br>
<p>If humans go to new planets they'll start to look and act differently in accordance to the natural landscape.</p>
<br>

<h4>11/1/21</h4>

<p>Nature and society is the earth while the government is the heavens. We're under their will and law to an extent.</p>
<br>
<p>Supposedly mana is from the heart, strong emotions. Hence blocked emotions cause a weak mana flow.</p>
<br>
<p>Vrigo = bowels.</p>
<br>
<p>Seems that magic uses the head.</p>
<br>
<p>I think the body first grows length wise then width or side wise. Or it depends on the persons element.</p>
<br>
<p>Abalone, clam, scallops, oyster, all foods full of sex power.</p>
<br>
<h4>12/1/21</h4>

<p>The worlds gone mad, everything’s a joke on tv. It's all entertainment but don't get lost in it.</p>
<br>
<p>The reason why sea food is good for the memory is because memory is water element related.</p>
<br>
<p>Either you learn to navigate the net or work in the world.</p>
<br>
<p>A cauldron or distillation belly is the lower energy center.</p>
<br>
<p>Oil then relates to the heart while volatilizes and vapors are the mind.</p>
<br>

<h4>13/1/21</h4>

<p>After building up energy in the lower energy center I feel it is needed to circulate it through the body.</p>
<br>
<p>I think in the past that we had mana based technology which was activated with our energies and mind. These were far more natural.</p>
<br>
<p>Seems like push ups are the ultimate man exercise. They enhance the back part of my arms and arm strength in general.</p>
<br>
<p>Don't hold space for bad thoughts or bad people. Not everything or everyone deserves it.</p>
<br>
<p>I think magic is just my force.</p>
<br>
<p>Control your focus, it is water for plants that can poison or heal.</p>
<br>

<h4>14/1/21</h4>

<p>Some people live completely in a world of archetypes, symbols and ideas instead of physical reality, or experiential reality.</p>
<br>

<h4>15/1/21</h4>

<p>I hypothesize that blood slowly falls down while spirit or hot air rises.</p>
<br>
<p>Focusing on the legs and letting blood circulate there is good. Too much makes the legs swell though.</p>
<br>
<p>Doing something every day is a good way to get better at it. But you gotta do it in a sustainable, healthy way that does not destroy you.</p>
<br>
<p>Control your fear, otherwise it controls you.</p>
<br>
<p>It seems that after I loose a bit of energy it regenerates from what I currently have in my guts.</p>
<br>
<p>I think horse stance is a way to open up the leg veins and expand them.</p>
<br>

<h4>16/1/21</h4>

<p>Mortal - Physique refining - Qi condensation - Foundations establishing - Core formation - Nascent soul - Soul formation - Soul transformation - Ascendant.</p>
<br>
<p>I believe that organs are cultivation or alchemical spaces. Hence organ harvesting from qi gong cultivators is lucrative.</p>
<br>
<p>Learning to grow bacteria would be a big alchemical technique. Growing them in different environments like that of crystals or herbal ones would be interesting.</p>
<br>
<p>I believe the lower energy center is the heat center of the body, apparently center of gravity too, or the guts is the heat center. Heart would be the blood generation center.</p>
<br>

<h4>17/1/21</h4>

<p>I think ley lines might be underground rivers, carrying water and mineral volatilizes.</p>
<br>
<p>Magic circuits are wires or electronic circuits.</p>
<br>
<p>Potentially when you refine something alchemically into a crystal it can adjust or change another item.</p>
<br>
<p>All edges can only either be round or jagged and all planes flat, curved or jagged. This is the geometry that makes up everything in existence that is physical.</p>
<br>
<p>Apparently body tempering rank is to temper your whole body with breath. So it'd be like external breath meditation.</p>
<br>
<p>"Body tempering improves the strength of ones body as a whole, cultivation focuses on strengthening different parts of the body at a time."</p>
<br>

<h4>18/1/21</h4>

<p>Karma is just what you've done in the past. Who you were builds your tomorrow. You wont magically get smited for doing things thought of as evil or bad the same way good deeds don’t always lead to rewards.</p>
<br>
<p>HGH is produced in the pituitary gland. Apparently it makes you more tired. It seems like an incredibly yin hormone. The pituitary gland controls the testicles.</p>
<br>
<p>Testicles link to the water veins, if steroids turn your nuts off then they might negatively effect that. Perhaps the water veins are related to estrogen? Might be why bodybuilders want to get so lean.</p>
<br>

<h4>19/1/21</h4>

<p>Focusing and activating the head is an interesting cultivation. It grants a ruler to the body and life, a navigator.</p>
<br>
<p>The people must govern themselves. This is the best system.</p>
<br>

<h4>20/1/21</h4>

<p>Apparently root vegetables are yang and beans are yin.</p>
<br>
<p>Computers are interfaces and monitors portals to the divine realm.</p>
<br>

<h4>21/1/21</h4>

<p>Hell is the underground lava channels in the earth. Prison is hell of the common world.</p>
<br>
<p>Old philosophies and religions tried to put the physical, material world into writing and teach it. This means the stars, the land, people, anatomy, animals, minerals, alchemy, etc.</p>
<br>
<p>Water is the body and light or heat is the life force. Physical matter is more crystallized water. It's taken on salt or matter and has become crystalline.</p>
<br>

<h4>22/1/21</h4>

<p>Oxides are no good for ingestion purposes. They cause too much gut acid and damage.<p>
<br>
<p>Thought - That the young and poor gain and gather skills like a vortex gathering dust. Gathering tools, resources, etc until eventually they can make their own business or find work.</p>
<br>
<p>True zen is to focus on nothing.</p>
<br>
<p>I wonder if I lost part of the metals oil when calcining it. It gave of an amazing white green glow and stayed hot for a while, bursting into flames every time I turned it over and mixed it.</p>
<br>
<p>Lye is similar in quality to semen. It is the essence of the marrow.</p>
<br>
<p>I wonder if distilling volatile oils from resin is the essence of that resin like how alcohol could be the essence of waters or liquids.
Resin distilling would be similar to fractional distillation of oil.</p>
<br>

<h4>23/1/21</h4>

<p>Modern internet economy is charging for clout.</p>
<br>
<p>I imagine that a person who has unlocked sexual nature in himself is able to have sex with people the same way an intelligent person can have intelligent conversations with others.</p>
<br>
<p>Magic note - Learn to feel the atmospheric magic and collect it. Learn to form and shape it, then see what it can do interacted with other objects.</p>
<br>
<p>Work smarter not harder.</p>
<br>

<h4>24/1/21</h4>

<p>Science misses the point because it goes too deep.</p>
<br>
</p>To travel the stars you need to be able to dematerialize, probably. Spiritualize essentially. Perhaps masters of old made a spiritual body to travel the stars or could dematerialize at will and went off, traveling distant planets.</p>
<br>

<h4>25/1/21</h4>

<p>Maybe adding crystals or salts to ore can enhance them magically.</p>
<br>
<p>Barley tea is nice and cooling.</p>
<br>
<p>Get to a point where you truly don't give a fuck about the outcome. Then apply some care.</p>
<br>
<p>I think the kidneys are the root or first organ of the testicles. So possibly testosterone and testicle hormones are strengthened from better kidneys.
Basically stronger kidneys = stronger nuts.</p>
<br>
<p>A magician apparently uses the heart to cultivate magic power.</p>
<br>

<h4>26/1/21</h4>

<p>If you bully your child or don't let them talk back and defend themselves then they will get bullied in society.</p>
<br>
<p>Days = Monday - Moon, Tuesday - Fire, Wednesday - Water, Thursday - Wood, Friday - Gold/metal, Saturday - Earth, Sunday - Sun.</p>
<br>
<p>Counting, numbers, days of the week, month, year, basic elements, genders. These are simple words to learn for languages.</p>
<br>
<p>One idea of making gold is to add something to mercury. Probably a mineral, it might be in one of the books.</p>
<br>
<p>Lead and mercury was one of the ideas, cook them together they say.</p>
<br>
<p>Daoists are spirit cultivators or yang cultivators.</p>
<br>

<h4>27/1/21</h4>

<p>Dry distilling fermented dried urine paste gives phosphorus apparently. I think phosphorus might be the spiritual component of semen. Phosphorus is in bones and apparently strengthens plant roots. It also is used in dna.</p>
<br>
<p>If you wanna snoop out money to be made you gotta hang around financial areas.</p>
<br>

<h4>28/1/21</h4>

<p>When you make a law or regulate something then you stop peoples natural ability to evolve with or around it.</p>
<br>
<p>Orange juice seems to have a base while soft drink does not.</p>
<br>

<h4>29/1/21</h4>

<p>Sound, light and space. The three highest elements. Maybe electromagnetism is just a function of space, like a pressure modality.
This is the electromagnetic spectrum - Throat is lower frequencies, third eye is visible light and the crown is electromagnetism.</p>
<br>
<p>Electricity is intense focus and magnetism is relaxed emanation in space.</p>
<br>
<p>Sex develops and strengthens the lower regions like legs, genitals and root like how talk, debate and collective imagining develops the mind, voice.</p>
<br>

<h4>31/1/21</h4>

<p>You can enhance and increase the natural ecosystem. I believe by adding fertilization, animals, more plants as food, water, etc.
Probably a continuous nitrogen, potassium, phosphorus cycle happening. Water running, living and dying life.</p>
<br>
<p>Minerals feed plants which feed animals. Spreading the correct fertilizer over a landscape may regenerate it.</p>
<br>
<p>Shamans, shrine maidens priests, etc used rituals and magic to restore the land.</p>
<br>
<p>I think doing things builds up the right side, while relaxing builds the left.</p>
<br>
<p>Ultimate supplements would be made by alchemizing lots of vegetables, fruits and animal parts into their minerals, protein and fats.</p>
