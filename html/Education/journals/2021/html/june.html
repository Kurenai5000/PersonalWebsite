<h4>1/6/21</h4>

<p>The penis is like a blood balloon.</p>
<br>
<h4>3/6/21</h4>

<p>Bridges are a kidney or back exercise.</p>
<br>
<p>The world is a self eating cycle.</p>
<br>
<h4>5/6/21</h4>

<p>The culture of the future will be built on individuals and their groups.</p>
<br>
<p>I think that building up the stamina first is building up the legs.</p>
<br>
<p>The money's in the land.</p>
<br>
<h4>6/6/21</h4>

<p>The kidney has pre natal qi.</p>
<br>
<p>In the past before technology people were much more using of the world. They spoke to one another, went outside, went to shops, spent their days leisurely outside the house.</p>
<br>
<h4>7/6/21</h4>

<p>Smell is a very subtle part or form of something.</p>
<br>
<p>There are two basic kinds of form, curved and angled. All things are made up of these or a combination of both.</p>
<br>
<h4>9/6/21</h4>

<p>The essence is what something boils down to. Rocks are a little harder to boil down.</p>
<br>
<h4>10/6/21</h4>

<p>Etheric energy is the electromagnetic stuff that you see when the hand is next to a white wall.</p>
<br>
<p>Astral is the imaginary realm or sight.</p>
<br>
<p>"According to Ayurveda [Indian medicine], semen is the last Dhatu [original element; core; constituent; the vital force in the human being] that is formed out of food. Out of food is manufactured chyle. Out of chyle comes blood. Out of blood comes flesh. Out of flesh comes fat. Out of fat comes bone. Out of bone comes marrow. Out of marrow comes semen. These are the Sapta Dhatus or the seven Dhatus that support this life and body."-unknown</p>
<br>
<p>Yin phase is when you don't do much or rest, relaxing activities. Yang is when you're active and doing stuff, work or play</p>
<br>
<p>Supposedly the air is a lower form of fire or warmth. So the warmth densified into air. Very interesting. Similarly the air densifies into water.<p/>
<br>
<h4>11/6/21</h4>

<p>I went outside and saw fog, made up of little particles which looked like they're raining down.</p>
<br>
<p>Clairvoyance simply means imaginary sight or being able to see stuff with your imagination. Similarly clairsentience and all the others, imaginary scent, taste, touch, sight, hearing.</p>
<br>
<h4>12/6/21</h4>

<p>Virgo is the excretory system. Cleaning your house and maids who handle this are aligned to those stars.</p>
<br>
<p>Magic power visibly is etheric energy.</p>
<br>
<h4>14/6/21</h4>

<p>A crystal oscillator might be a robot heart.</p>
<br>
<h4>15/6/21</h4>

<p>Men fight with fists and women with words.</p>
<br>
<p>A talking relationship is a spiritual one while a physical, sexual or doing relationship is more an earthly one.</p>
<br>
<p>Spirits travel on heat channels or heat pathways. Heat rises from earth to outer space, perhaps spirits travel across those if they're light enough.</p>
<br>
<p>To find out what herbs do you pick them and eat them.</p>
<br>
<h4>18/6/21</h4>

<p>Orcs are green maybe relating to iron.</p>
<br>
<p>People are just people, stop overestimating them, stop thinking that they're so special or strong.</p>
<br>
<h4>20/6/21</h4>

<p>Alcohol is kind of like herbal, grain or fruit urine.</p>
<br>
<p>I think alcohol relates to the kidneys and bladder.</p>
<br>
<h4>21/6/21</h4>

<p>Water is the body, steam is the spirit. The body is the earth, meridians are the rivers and streams.</p>
<br>
<p>Feel the flow within the body, feel your veins pulse. Gathering qi into the lower dan tien and then circulating it out simultaneously through the meridians is a decent technique.</p>
<br>
<h4>24/6/21</h4>

<p>Lunges are a good exercise for the hips.</p>
<br>
<p>Pepper can make you less high. Similar to mustard seeds stopping that woman from being drunk in east of eden.</p>
<br>
<p>Observe thousands of animals to understand the formation of animalist life. Observe thousands of plants to understand the formation of plant life. Observe thousands of minerals to understand the formation of mineral form.</p>
<br>
<p>Within these you will see common archetypes, similarities and patterns. This is one hint to understanding all form.</p>
<br>
<p>Condense breath in the whole body.</p>
<br>
<h4>25/6/21</h4>

<p>Air is up, earth is down, fire is expansion and water is compression, maybe.</p>
<br>
<p>Magic is basically just making what you pretend real.</p>
<br>
<h4>26/6/21</h4>

<p>I found that breathing into the lower dan tien region made it warm. Then I compressed it into a centre. This is how I made my qi center and gained a lot of spirit or body warmth.</p>
<br>
<p>If people think of you after you die then that feeds the soul, keeping you spiritually alive.</p>
<br>
<p>Garlic can defend against ghosts or spirits. Iron as well. Though excesses of these burn the guts.</p>
<br>
<p>All desire, all thoughts, all feelings are a distraction from pure emptiness. This is the immortal state. The lower levels are where desires, thoughts and other things exist. Hunger and thirst are a distraction to this state.</p>
<br>
<p>A magician needs to learn how to say ten things with one word and one thing with ten words.</p>
<br>
<h4>27/5/21</h4>

<p>Fat lubricates, protein is the original matter, salt is good for thought and carbs for speech.</p>
<br>
<h4>28/6/21</h4>

<p>Reduce herbal resin slowly instead of quick to not burn it.</p>
<br>
<p>Realgar is ridiculously yang and powerful.</p>
<br>
<h4>29/6/21</h4>

<p>Perhaps grinding and mixing dead animals, plants and minerals together will make a soil, a fertility medium for life. That and water.</p>
<br>
<h4>30/6/21</h4>

<p>Freedom is to stop thinking about what others think and say. You can do whatever you want.</p>
<br>
<p>One pressure medium creates space by expanding out and being hypothetically magnetic while the other electric might create matter through suns, or pressurizing space so much that matter forms. Hence first yin, then yang, then yin again then yang once planets form life.</p>
<br>
<p>Earth organ = bowels.</p>
