 <h4>1/3/25</h4>
 <br>

<p>Maybe try zink galvanizing spray for pla to make it conductive.</p>
<br>

<p>You can start by creating a UI then give it functionality or making a backend of that UI first, aka the functionality or functions of everything.</p>
<br>

<p>Supposedly shutting down part of the frontal lobe helped with psychic abilities. Might be to reduce the logical part of the brain. Maybe the psychic abilities to interact the world come from the rear?</p>
<br>

<p>Don't neglect your heart when doing muscle training. Sprints, jogging and martial arts or really anything that makes you move and breathe gets it going. You can run in your home or yard back and forth instead of going around the block. Think of it like a muscle, do sets of work, rest and another set.</p> 
<br>

<h4>2/3/25</h4>
 <br>

<p>I think a lot of these spiritual drugs that made people feel lighter that the daoists took were heart drugs or heart stimulation.
Heart meditation as well might be it.</p>
<br>

<p>Supposedly magnetic fields can influence time and space.</p>
<br>

<h4>3/3/25</h4>
<br>

<p>People want to take drugs to help them cope with stress, anxiety and the pains of modern life, but it's through experiencing these pains and accepting them, bearing through them, even as horrible as they can be that you grow stronger and able to handle them. Otherwise you build your foundation on drugs or crutches that can be easily taken away or turn against you when things get even tougher.</p>
<br>

<p>Make plastic ball bearings with cylinders.</p>
<br>

<p>Acid and a base makes a salt.(Postnote - I know this is common science but apply it to alchemy.)</p>
<br>

<p>The circulatory flow in the body is blood flow, it is what delivers nutrients to heal the body. I think strengthening this and enhancing it will heal the body. Circulatory blockages can be helped through cardio training. Food generates more blood.</p>
<br>

<h4>4/3/25</h4>
<br>

<p>The heart is the bodies engine. Or it's like the bodies pump.</p>
<br>

<p>Oxidizers can be added to acids to help metals dissolve because metals form protective oxide layers which can disrupt the dissolving of it.</p>
<br>

<p>I believe in the greater good. I think if you follow it that you end up doing good things for the world around you. It's like a north star or guiding light that shows you a proper path to follow.</p>
<br>

<h4>5/3/25</h4>
<br>

<p>Majors controls and flows of the body - nervous system energy/focus, arteries/blood, muscle/tension/relaxation, weight. The lightest one is focus which is very quick. Blood is also fairly quick. Tension/relaxation and weight is slower.</p>
<br>

<p>I wonder if the philosophers stone of metal are volatile salts?(Postnote - Probably not as volatile salts seem more to be used in "creating it". Essentially extracting essence from metal.)</p>
<br>

<h4>6/3/25</h4>
<br>

<p>Try to get an hour or two of personal project work each day outside of your job and house work.</p>
<br>

<p>The deepest traumas are within the furthests parts of the spine.</p>
<br>

<h4>7/3/25</h4>
<br>

<p>Use node.js to make a basic website server.</p>
<br>

<p>I'm sick of being new at things and having to learn stuff like a beginner. When will I finally be able to live my life.</p>
<br>

<p>Humanoid robots would be a good tool for resource harvesting, building and war. They would be natural to move around in and control, an extension of the body.</p>
<br>

<p>I feel less neurotic when I don't meditate, like my life starts to ground back into physical reality. I feel less godlike but in that godlike state it's not like I'd do much of anything. Here I feel like I'm playing the game instead of spectating it.</p>
<br>

<h4>8/3/25</h4>
<br>

<p>Darkness maxing. Working shitty jobs, dealing with life problems and society, feeling like crap all the time. Maybe this is spiritual cultivation but in reverse and will make me a pro at regular life.</p>
<br>

<h4>9/3/25</h4>
<br>

<p>ESP32 chips are compromised.</p>
<br>

<h4>10/3/25</h4>
<br>

<p>I'm starting to notice everywhere is getting very overpopulated after the 2020-2023 era. Shopping centers and roads are always busy. Suburbs are becoming like cities. I think there has been tons of new housing development and lots of immigrants coming in but the current infrastructure cannot handle it.  I guess the idea of "build more houses" doesn't work long term if you don't solve the root problem of overpopulation due to immigration.</p>
<br>

<h4>11/3/25</h4>
<br>

<p>The mind decides the future because you can think of what you want to do or could do. This doesn't guarantee it will work, but it will give you an idea or a path. Like a navigation or lookup system.</p>
<br>

<p>Sound creates a pressure modulation in the air.</p>
<br>

<p>I think ores, metals and crystals can be farmed like potatoes. We already do it with some crystals. There must be a way to grow minerals underground or in a lab environment.</p>
<br>

<p>Earth is a big capacitor. Earth caries negative charge, air is insulator, top layer is positive.</p>
<br>

<p>Protein and sugar are like the yin and yang of fuel, then carbs would be in the middle.</p>
<br>

<p>If you are doing something passively it drains your "passive energy". This is negative energy or stamina at the root of the body. I imagine farmers have a lot of this as a whole crop field probably drains this energy.</p>
<br>

<h4>12/3/25</h4>
<br>

<p>Focusing on the heart then another part of the body seems to heal it. I guess this is blood healing the body or its electromagnetism? Either way, no wonder there's all the green and heart symbolism for healers.</p>
<br>

<p>Maybe dry distilling a vegetable essence mixed with ash yields a volatile crystal or a plant stone?</p>
<br>

<p>I gotta get to the point where nothing phases or hurts me anymore. At that point I can really start to grind.</p>
<br>

<p>Hair and nails are like a polymer.</p>
<br>

<p>Maybe avoid meditation during the summer or full moon periods.</p>
<br>

<h4>13/3/25</h4>
<br>

<p>The lower three centers are of sleep/survival, sex/regeneration and hunger/power. To gain success you forgo sex and funnel that energy into your power and survival drives. This blunts the soul long term though.</p>
<br>

<p>Smell is the spiritual sense to taste, taste being the material/physical. Or the external(Smell)/internal(Taste) duality of the same sense.</p>
<br>

<p>Schools and educational institutions should focus more on practical exams, experience and tests compared to theoretical ones if they want to produce students who can do as opposed to ones who know.</p>
<br>

<p>Fighting social liberalism is to fight the cultural force of the boomer.</p>
<br>

<p>If you want to learn to do, then practice. Otherwise if you wish to understand, then study.</p>
<br>

<p>"Organic metal compounds, also known as organometallic compounds, are compounds that contain at least one metal-carbon bond. These compounds combine the properties of both organic and inorganic chemistry, allowing for a wide range of applications in various fields, including catalysis, materials science, and medicine. There are several types of organic metal compounds, which can be classified based on their structure, the metal involved, and the type of ligands attached to the metal center. Here are some common types of organic metal compounds:</p>

<p>Metal carbonyls: These compounds consist of a metal center bonded to one or more carbonyl (CO) ligands. Examples include nickel carbonyl (Ni(CO)4) and iron pentacarbonyl (Fe(CO)5).</p>

<p>Metal alkyls and aryls: These compounds contain a metal center bonded to one or more alkyl (e.g., methyl, ethyl) or aryl (e.g., phenyl) groups. Examples include tetramethyllead (Pb(CH3)4) and ferrocene (Fe(C5H5)2).</p>

<p>Metal cyclopentadienyl complexes (metallocenes): These compounds consist of a metal center sandwiched between one or more cyclopentadienyl (Cp) ligands. Examples include ferrocene (Fe(C5H5)2) and titanocene dichloride (Ti(C5H5)2Cl2).</p>

<p>Metal phosphine complexes: These compounds contain a metal center coordinated to one or more phosphine ligands (PR3). Examples include Wilkinson's catalyst (RhCl(PPh3)3) and Vaska's complex (IrCl(CO)(PPh3)2).</p>

<p>Metal carbene complexes: These compounds contain a metal center bonded to a carbene ligand, which is a divalent carbon species with two unshared electrons. Examples include Grubbs' catalyst (RuCl2(PCy3)2(CHPh)) and Schrock's catalyst (Mo(CH-t-Bu)(NAr)[OCMe(CF3)2]2).</p>

<p>Metal arene complexes: These compounds consist of a metal center coordinated to an aromatic ring, such as benzene or toluene. Examples include chromium hexacarbonyl (Cr(CO)6) and bis(benzene)chromium (Cr(C6H6)2).</p>

<p>Metal hydrides: These compounds contain a metal center bonded to one or more hydrogen atoms. Examples include lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH4) and sodium borohydride (NaBH4)." - Gab AI</p>
<br>

<p>Sublimation can yield an incredibly pure crystaline solid. This is a strange state of matter which is solid, but can become liquid and also a gas. It is the most perfected and pure substance I have found.</p>
<br>

<p>I think that alkaloids might be the "plant stone" or "volatile salt" of plants in alchemical terms. Base to acid extractions are incredibly similar to how metallic "oils", the organic metal compounds are extracted.</p>
<br>

<p>This alchemist crystal seems to be the highest state of physical matter. The most refined part of that thing(Prime material).</p>
<br>

<p>"Take any herb which is potent in medicine, and either extract the tincture with spirit of wine, or distil in the common way; reserve the distilled water, or tincture, when separated from the fæces, for use. Then take the feces, or Caput Mortuum, and calcine it to a calx. Grind this to powder. That done, take the water, or tincture, and mix them together; distil again, and calcine, forcing the moisture over by a retort, in a wary process, calcining and cohobating the spirit on the salt till it attains a perfect whiteness and oily nature, like the finest alkali, commonly called Flemish. As your salt requires it in the process, have in readiness more of the extracted tincture, or distilled spirit, that you may not work it, viz., the salt, too dry; and yet proceed cautiously, not adding too much of the moisture, so that the dealbation, or whitening, may keep visibly heightening at every repetition of the process. Frequent experiments may enable you to push it on to a redness, but a fine yellow is the best of all; for the process tends, in its perfection at this period, to a state of dryness, and must be managed with a strong fire. By following these directions, you have here the two tinctures in the Vegetable Kingdom, answering to the white and red tinctures in the mineral." - Collectanea Chemica, ed. by A.E. Waite</p>
<br>

<h4>14/3/25</h4>
<br>

<p>You can use silicon sealant to make gaskets.</p>
<br>

<p>Meditation enhances your ability to focus.</p>
<br>

<p>Circular loop coil like in dimension W. Interdimensional induction coils/resonators.</p>
<br>

<h4>15/3/25</h4>
<br>

<p>In programming you're simulating things. There's more text based programming where you simulate words, logic and text then there's slightly higher level where you simulate images, videos, visuals, etc. There's also programming to control dongles, motors, actuators, etc. I guess the logic part of programming is just controlling things.</p>
<br>

<p>If hard work isn't working then you have to overcome your genetics so to speak. Some people seem to need to work 10x harder for 1x result while some can work 1x as hard for 10x results.</p>
<br>

<h4>17/3/25</h4>
<br>

<p>People reminisce that the 60's without as much technology as today was better because of that. But I think it's more that they had far better social and economic times. We could have a golden age today with phones and computers if we get our countries together.</p>
 
<p>Similarly people think that technology is the cause of us connecting or dating less. I think this is also just a symptom of societal illness, not inherently a problem of technology.</p> 
<br>

<p>Ammonia is like nitrogen water.</p>
<br>

<p>Some people gain stability from companies or family or groups instead of having their own. This is how they can function in the world without caring for themselves or having a strong root.</p>
<br>

<h4>18/3/25</h4>
<br>

<p>Immigration is being spoken against now in the mainstream. This is because of the upcoming robot takover of jobs I think. The immigrants played their role as cheap labor to bolster up companies and now have little use.</p>
<br>

<p>"Style is an obscure term for the relationship between content and form." -Nanga/@NangaParbat1618</p>
<br>

<p>Seemingly the most important thing is your ability to endure and to continue.</p>
<br>

<p>Supposedly tesla coils are a pump for aetheric energy. There might be unlimited negative charge in the earth and positive charge in the higher sky. If you can tap into that and harvest it, drain or draw it then you could make free energy.</p>
<br>

<p>Vaccination and grafting is similar. You are injecting properties of one thing into another. I wonder if that's a reason why vaccines all seem to have weird parts of animals in them.</p>
<br>

<p>Womens value goes down when they can't have children as mens go when they can't make money anymore/can't work.</p>
<br>

<h4>19/3/25</h4>
<br>

<p>Apparently, hydroxide can dissolve certain stones and ores.</p>
<br>

<p>The more you can sit in confusion and not get frustrated or annoyed, the quicker you can learn.</p>
<br>

<p>Being a spiritual entity in the modern age would be uploading yourself to a computer. I think that might be possible, to locally run your own mind on a computer. Essentially an AI. You'd be free from some struggles of matter like eating and sleeping.</p>
<br>

<p>It's possible when someone feels strong lust towards another person is just that other person is sexually empty or needing to refill themselves. Similar to if you were around someone who's hungry, it makes you hungry.</p>
<br>

<p>People try to give others their programming. "These are my daily habits/loops, here are my philosophies, my methods and things I do. If you do them, you can become like me." I imagine in the future you'll be able to download a "lifepath", skills, routines, experiences, etc to customize your life.</p>
<br>

<p>People can get addicted to emotions. You have the choice to stop a thought and not continue it, but do you like the feeling from it? Do you like feeling angry, feeling depressed or helpless? If not then stop it. Choose peace instead of stimulation.</p>
<br>

<p>I believe we can understand anything, because I want to. I can divide the whole world, the bodies anatomy into archetypes and understand each part. Nothing escapes the mind and eyes of a sage(a wise man). Nothing is beyond our intellect, if only you can learn to understand.</p>
<br>

<h4>20/3/25</h4>
<br>

<p>Old people seem to be afflicted physically by the symptoms of excess masturbation/sex.</p>
<br>

<p>I think the amount of abuse that the young men and women are experiencing from foreigners/immigrants in the workplace is completely undoing 35 years of anti racism training.</p>
<br>

<p>The only real hack for reality I can find is endurance. As long as you're able to do the right thing, meaning navigating yourself correctly, then you just need to do 5x-10x the amount. So, building stamina first is important. Try to max out how much of something you can do, then increase the quality.</p>
<br>

<p>If you are unsatisfied with the amount of return or yield you are getting, doing more might be a good idea. Stamina is more important initially, just to fill things out, then you can refine.</p>
<br>

<h4>21/3/25</h4>
<br>

<p>A stew is with the addition of a thickening agent like flour or starch and water. A stir-fry is with oil or some water, though some thickeners can be used and the end water content is less than a stew.</p>
<br>

<p>To get more stuff done you need to optimize your time. Compress how many things you can do within a certain amount of time.
When you start getting more done than just your maintenance duties, then you start moving forward.</p>
<br>

<p>The internet needs the sense of touch.</p>
<br>

<p>Life in the masculine sense is a never ending advancement of status, money, gear, body, etc. Tribal cultures found a place to relax, a state of harmony with their environment and said that was enough. White and east Asian people kept going and advancing. Eventually you can decide when to relax off your bounty or to keep going and turn what you have into more.</p>
<br>

<p>The secret is just doing more. If you grow 1 meter by 1 meter of potatoes you get a little. When you 10x that you get some. 100x that and you get a lot.</p>
<br>

<h4>22/3/25</h4>
<br>

<p>Defeat that weak feeling of satisfaction and giving up. Keep working. Stay focused mentally.</p>
<br>

<p>Abstain from pleasure to stay focused on work.</p>
<br>

<p>I think there's a link between milk and ceramic.</p>
<br>

<p>The incel epidemic is something society isn't taking seriously, but instead is making fun of. Probably around 40% of young men are unmarried and going to take higher positions in society in the workforce over the next 10 years. How will they shape society, that which has had no empathy for their issues?(Postnote - Heard the last stat was 60% of men under 30 are single. Yeesh.)</p>
<br>

<h4>23/3/25</h4>
<br>

<p>The anus or bowels, genitals or prostate and bladder area are all three tension points which can be tensed to send energy up, transmuting their essences. Otherwise they can be relaxed, to gather yin energy and fortify the physical body.  I think physical immortality is by healing and strengthening these points.</p>
<br>

<p>Do the things you are bad at or unconfident about enough that it becomes natural and you don't need to think about it any more.</p>
<br>

<p>Maybe through hyper relaxation while focusing on energy you can materialize/density it.</p>
<br>

<p>Your environment is making you ill, the people around you, room, air, etc.</p>
<br>

<p>Shame comes from the bladder.</p>
<br>

<h4>24/3/25</h4>
<br>

<p>Generative AI is a bit like an automobile/car for people. It lets them do things far beyond what they usually would be able to.</p>
<br>

<p>In programming, with a list of numbers there's only so much you can do to those numbers. Add them together into a single value, times each number by 2, remove a value from each number, add a letter onto them, etc. Lots of things, but ultimately there will be common, repeated actions like recipes or techniques. If you can learn all of those then you can understand programming with arrays or lists of things.</p>

<p>Life is the same where things seem complex, but ultimately there's only so many options, methods, ways things can work. If you learn all of these, then get comfortable with being in the experience of these, then you can understand and act easily in life. It becomes routine and memory. Your intelligence decides how fast you can understand these and to what extent. Your body is how well you do practically.</p>
<br>

<p>Callback is when a function calls another as an argument. Recursive is when a function calls its self.</p>
<br>

<p>The muscles are all connected so they can form their own pathways. So instead of breaking up muscles into singular ones like deltoid or pectoral you can see the entire spanning length of muscles connecting.</p>
<br>

<p>I wonder if it's possible to fuse two elements together by putting them in a chamber and heating it up hot enough until they "melt" or "fuse" together from pressure and heat. Assumably this would allow you to fuse two elements into another depending on their density.</p>

<p>If I understand correctly, when you heat metal it goes from solid to liquid to gas then to plasma. Most of everything does. But apparently in this ionized plasma state where they have lost electronics and become positively charged, they loose the ability to electrostatically repulse and can fuse.</p>

<p>Maybe through frequency you could order the atoms in a pattern of another element. Or add in another chemical to make them transmute/order to that.</p>

<p>I think the philosophers stone might be created from this fusion process maybe, or at least the chemicals becoming plasma. Maybe that's what the wierd light is, plasma.</p>

<p>Modern big fusion reactors seem to just be large scale plasma controller chambers. So they control the plasma into a wheel or other shape with electromagnetism like those small tests people do in jars.</p>

<p>In the future there will be small fusion reactors you can buy like a 3d printer than prints any matter you want so to speak, or it "fuses" it from a base gas like hydrogen.</p>

<p>The head is plasma or fire, chest/heart area is air. The belly is probably water and butt earth? So then there's technically only the four elements in the body, though, electromagnetism is the whole. It's like the gameboard or the everything that spans across it. The top of the head is electrostatic and base of the body is magnetic and it slowly goes to that pole from the center which is electromagnetic or neutral.</p>

<p>So in the head we can volatilize our matter or body or life and think in order to create new things then recondense it back down into physical matter.</p>
<br>

<p>Above around 5-10k degrees celsius you start to hit the plasma level.</p>

<p>Assumably there isn't a state of matter above plasma or maybe some kind of super plasma which is just the peak of it the same way there isn't anything denser than matter except just really dense matter. But I guess some scientists talk about exotic matter so who knows.</p>

<p>Maybe electrostatic fields are like cold plasmas in a way, the ones that start to glow, the ionic wind. That might be a key to cold fusion/transmutation.</p>

<p>The heavenly realm is the realm of plasma. Perhaps it's possible to enter it and travel there. Maybe the sages who turned themselves into a plasma state, an ultra spiritual state were able to travel in these realms and materialize again on other planets or realities.</p>

<p>Friction/tension seem to raise states of matter. Relaxation, gentleness lowers them.</p>
<br>

<p>Some people need to learn impulse control like animals do.</p>
<br>

<h4>25/3/25</h4>
<br>

<p>Maybe underground there is electrochemistry going on similar to batteries or electrolysis and that makes new ore through "cold" or electrical fusion. Alkali or acidic or salty vapor could start the process.</p>
<br>

<p>Think of things like an rpg strategy game where if you invest down you'll get more, probably.</p>
<br>

<p>Figure out a way to "farm" on a pc.</p>
<br>

<p>Might be able to use a microwave to excite air/gas into plasma instead of electrodes for a fusion reactor. Airtight microwave.</p>
<br>

<p>Maybe the union of yoga is when the mind and body are fully aligned. Essentially you can mentally do whatever you want in a physical form without the physical restrictions of sickness, weakness.</p>
<br>

<h4>27/3/25</h4>
<br>

<p>5 tcm elements and planets - Wood - Jupiter, Fire - Mars, Earth - Saturn, Metal - Venus, Water - Mercury.</p>
<br>

<p>Eventually anything you do or are engaged in becomes hard or difficult to continue. These times are like the wind that test the structure or a earthquake that tests the foundation.</p>
<br>

<p>White or previously white countries are only for the rich nowadays. I think once robots become common as workers that you will only have rich people and robots in these countries.</p>
<br>

<h4>28/3/25</h4>
<br>

<p>I wish I could just download knowledge straight into my head. Learning is so outdated.</p>
<br>

<h4>29/3/25</h4>
<br>

<p>Cultivating the water element definitely seems to gain hormones and regeneration, sexual energy.</p>
<br>

<p>JavaScript is hard in a higher level way that c is hard in a lower level one.</p>
<br>

<h4>30/3/25</h4>
<br>

<p>Garlic, onions, salt and pork are all good foods for stamina.</p>
<br>

<p>Nostalgia is one of the sweetest feelings.</p>
<br>

<h4>31/3/25</h4>
<br>

<p>The west has trouble accepting human difference in categories of race, sex, status and age. You can see how AI's have been trained not to offer stats of these easily. Though, corporations love to have this knowledge because it lets them accurately pin people down and formularize them. It's just not talked about openly.</p>
<br>

<p>If someone was born with an ill fate, does this mean they will be weak and unfortunate for the rest of their live? These people seem to come with harsh trials, life troubles and bad luck. I think that an ill fate seems to manifest as weak organs in the body. Perhaps through strengthening these organs with exercise, diet and other means that the persons bad fate could be alleviated or fixed.</p>
