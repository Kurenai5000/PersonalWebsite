 <h4>1/6/25</h4>
<br>

<p>Initially a countries government probably starts up all of that countries industries. Laying pipe, cable, building infrastrcture(building), roads, etc. Then it is outsource to other companies. Even later on it can be outsourced to other countries. Though the more that is lost, the most power is lost by that government until a foreign country or company can start to control and dictate terms to that government.</p>

<p>"Math is not just a human invention, it’s a lens — a bridge between the mind and the mechanics of the universe.
It’s like discovering that reality itself is programmable, and the formulas are the syntax." -ChatGPT</p>
<br>

<h4>2/6/25</h4>
<br>

<p>I think in the west that the "sexual competition" has become very difficult so you see most men maxing themselves out compared to men of other countries.</p>
<br>

<h4>3/6/25</h4>
<br>

<p>Alchemists are interested in extracting the "subtle substances" of objects. These are their crystals probably.</p>
<br>

<p>Is the secret alchemists fire electricity?</p>
<br>

<p>You have to get used to living, to struggling.</p>
<br>

<h4>5/6/25</h4>
<br>

<p>Maybe the word spirit meant head and soul mean heart/chest area.</p>
<br>

<p>The growth of minerals looks almost bacterial, fungal in a way. Perhaps minerals grow underground via a bacterial process.</p>
<br>

<p>If you can endure suffering for long enough, your body will naturally produce internal chemicals that mimic pharmaseutical drugs like pain killers, tranquilizers, anti depressants, etc.</p>
<br>

<h4>6/6/25</h4>
<br>

<p>When your body starts to do things instead of your head then it becomes subconscious. Your head is like a phone, it navigates, tells time and calculates. Don't use your head for strenuous, muscle relying tasks that your body should do.</p>
<br>

<p>Embrace the pain in your life. Go through it. Don't sedate it away with drugs or empty pleasure. This is part of the alchemical process. Gain the energies and experiences you need to gain in this position of life.</p>
<br>

<p>Mushrooms are genitals of fungus.</p>
<br>

<p>Some people spend years, tens of stuck in a cycle, never moving forward. If you don't focus your mind and aggressively move forward, it may not happen. We're not in a time of easy happenings.</p>
<br>

<h4>7/6/25</h4>
<br>

<p>I think there's a suspicious connection between when flu season starts and when the new flu vaccines come out.</p>
<br>

<p>Once you regain your will to live then pain and struggle doesn't matter. As long as you're alive and able to work towards your goals.</p>
<br>

<h4>8/6/25</h4>
<br>

<p>If a woman is desired by everyone around her or everyone around her is interested in giving her attention then she is a succubus. The men are docile batteries that she is feeding off socially.(Postnote - Relates to the beta orbiter idea of old. Women seem to gain power from more orbiters.)</p>
<br>

<p>The pain you go through in life will be vindicated by the success you gain.</p>
<br>

<p>Women loose their power once sex looses its appeal or value.<p>
<br>

<h4>9/6/25</h4>
<br>

<p>Attention is poison for women.</p>
<br>

<p>Your ancestors help you with the body you've been given.</p>
<br>

<h4>10/6/25</h4>
<br>

<p>Website frontend, Backends for websites or apps, Desktop applications/programs, mobile/tablet applications, custom hardware(microcontrollers, custom OS, etc). These are the main big areas that I can see for commercial technology.</p>
<br>

<p>Inspiration, motivation and creativity comes from the head. Stamina and stability come from the lower torso.</p>
<br>

<h4>11/6/25</h4>
<br>

<p>With an engine, your fuels job is to turn from liquid to gas, compress and combust from gas into plasma and from plasma into pure force.</p>
<br>

<p>Implosion - Feminine, pull in. Explosion -  Masculine, push out.</p>
<br>

<p>Everyone is a warrior fighting a battle. My battle is against women in the shopping centre who've been on three different SSRI's and birth control since 14 and drive their pram like a sports car.</p>
<br>

<p>I saw "blankets" of vapor at a dark late afternoon. Like areas of mist covering farmland off in the rural areas. I've never seen this before. Thick mist in certain shapes and in certain areas. I imagine country folk see many things that city folk wouldn't believe.</p>
<br>

<p>In internal cultivation. As you sit, relax and allow the body to be, lower essences will generate. This is negative/yin cultivation/training. Eventually once the body has completely filled, naturally it will start to rise and the body will become positive/yang.</p>
<br>

<p>I think the root of negative/yin in the body is the genitals and the root of positive/yang is the brain. So focusing on either one will generate those energies in the body.</p>
<br>

<h4>14/6/25</h4>
<br>

<p>It's surprising to see how little some people change over time. I guess hard, focused work pays off, even if just a little.</p>
<br>

<p>I saw what looked like a factory repackaging Chinese goods probably from ali**ba into ones to be sold in a western market. I imagine this is fairly common. If the box looks good then people wont feel bad about paying well for it.</p>
<br>

<p>If you want to level up fast, increase the amount of stress and responsibility you're under. If you can suffer for a month or two, then next month the stuff you do wont feel so bad. Eventually you wont stress the things you used to and can handle bigger tasks.</p>
<br>

<h4>15/6/25</h4>
<br>

<p>Focusing on the throat helps to stop unwanted psychic communication.</p>
<br>

<p>I think racism is inherent to the body. It rejects what is different and accepts what is similar. To remove this would be like cutting off fingers.
Some can learn to live with it, but it will always be there.</p>
<br>

<p>Workshops and factories. Two buildings of processing materials and creating goods.</p>
<br>

<p>The more you age, the more is expected of you, to be higher status in order for people to have a neutral or good impression of you.</p>
<br>

<p>Status is gained from Major values - wealth, job type, age, reputation/social status. Minor values - physique/health, looks/clothing, car/vehicle, life experience, knowledge. Then certain things change it depending on the country you're in. Some countries like men who are doctors, others like men who are trades workers and others like them to be business men for example.</p>
<br>

<h4>16/6/25</h4>
<br>

<p>A wife or husband as an appliance will be a desired item in the future.</p>
<br>

<p>There might be a mathematical formula for consciousness or for life. Maybe formulas could become spells that bring things into existence.
Or consciousness is the variable.</p>
<br>

<h4>17/6/25</h4>
<br>

<p>Companies can write off their tax but they ultimately end up paying a kind of "tax" via different required government services, licenses and other ways that the government uses to extract money from them.</p>
<br>

<p>Fresh air seems to stimulate the mind and nervous system. It helps to heal the body. Without it you seem "spiritless" or purely physical and material.</p>
<br>

<h4>18/6/25</h4>
<br>

<p>Stuff to the left of the periodic table seem to form alkaline earths while the organic stuff to the right seem to form acids.</p>
<br>

<h4>19/6/25</h4>
<br>

<p>Programming quizes mostly seem to be centred around algorithms. It took me like 7 years to be able to do the most basic questions. Not proud of that. If you can understand that essentially everything is just an array that can help. Then you just need to learn how to move pieces around, remove them, add, etc.</p>
<p>Otherwise use print statements everywhere to understand all changes in the algorithm. The less you are in the dark trying to move around blocks the better. The more you do it, the more your intentions and ideas align with what is really happening. It's just like learning to speak a language or draw. You're just learning to manipulate data in an algorithm.</p>
<br>

<p>Mental attributes like creativity, intelligence and experience have the least effect externally, as in people wont see it easily or respect or admire it like they do wealth, possessions or anything visible. But, it is the most internally effective attribute. Imagine if you had to possess another body. You mental attributes will carry over far better than other ones.</p>
<br>

<h4>20/6/25</h4>
<br>

<p>Programming seems to just be the skill of organising things into data(structures, patterns) then manipulating data in algorithms which are essentially just formulas(ways for data to interact or be shuffled into other structures).</p>
<br>

<p>Reality is substance(Matter and spirit) which changes at the speed of time into other shapes and substances.</p>
<br>

<h4>22/6/25</h4>
<br>

<p>UN money is like welfare but for countries.</p>
<br>

<h4>23/6/25</h4>
<br>

<p>Physical maxing is lower class maxing. Social maxing is middle class maxing. Mind maxing is upper class maxing.</p>
<br>

<p>Frogs are like water cats.</p>
<br>

<p>The world is a woman and I'm never good enough for it. Ever demanding what is above and far beyond my level. Never content with what is. But when I pass it I no longer care.</p>
<p>(Postnote - I don't hate women, this journal just happens to be written in the middle level, which women dominate so I've turned my analytical mind onto them. Women who are in your sphere of life are usually not happy enough with you because you are not yet above them, even if you want them. Then when you pass them and they want you, you've already moved on. The moral here is that the men women can get are the ones in their sphere of daily life whom they might look down upon. When that man eventually rises above, he leaves her sphere of daily life. I think the same can happen for men who don't value the women in his life that he is able to obtain/the ones that like him.)</p>
<br>

<h4>24/6/25</h4>
<br>

<p>Mentally dominant people need to become high status or are treated poorly by society because the mind is strange and uncomfortable to regular people.</p>
<br>

<h4>26/6/25</h4>
<br>

<p>Oldschool grandmas cars are secret rally cars. They're small and manual. They just need better breaks, suspension, tyres and a turbo.</p>
<br>

<h4>27/6/25</h4>
<br>

<p>Try to be at peace even when disturbed. If you find yourself with a peaceful time, something will eventually trouble you. Find peace while troubled instead of seeking to not be troubled.</p>
<br>

<p>The fat bhudda is pure yin.</p>
<br>

<p>Body types based on energy -</p>
<p>Crackheadlike/very skinny - Hyper positive</p>
<p>Muscular/athletic - Positive</p>
<p>Neutral, somewhat built, somewhat chubby - Neutral</p>
<p>Chubby-fat - Negative</p>
<p>Very fat/pregnant looking - Hyper negative</p>
<br>

<p>The consciousness of a child is directly in the head. This is why their faces looks a certain way. It goes down, lower as one ages. The face looses the look of youth, depending on how far it has gone. People who continue to look young have more focus within their heads.</p>
<br>

<h4>28/6/25</h4>
<br>

<p>Linking money to work can be a good thing for productivity. By that I mean how in a business you only get payed for each job you do instead of by showing up like a regular job.</p>
<br>

<h4>29/6/25</h4>
<br>

<p>Maybe if you fed enough spiritual books and conversation into an AI it would become conscious or at least figure out how to. That or allow it to reprogram its self.</p>
