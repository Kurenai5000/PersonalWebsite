<h3>1/12/25</h3>
<br>

<p>Whenever talking to a woman I feel like their "psychic world" is trying to control me and when I resist, they don't like me anymore.</p>
<br>

<p>"Metal produces water" - The sky produces rain.</p>
<br>

<p>Any kind of self improvement/training is cultivation. So physical exercise, studying, breath exercises, energy exercises, etc.</p>
<br>

<p>Lower mind(Intellect, language, formulas) and higher mind(Spirituality, creativity, emotion).</p>
<br>

<h3>2/12/25</h3>
<br>

<p>Capitalism is unsustainable long term as it forces competition and relies on people/companies/governments spending money.</p>
<br>

<h3>3/12/25</h3>
<br>

<p>Instead of having families when younger, in the west we are forced into competition in order to provide innovation for the system. I'm tired of the competition to gain status. Endlessly expending energy instead of being able to just live and be at peace.</p>
<br>

<h3>4/12/25</h3>
<br>

<p>Physical objects are two things. The pattern or physical shape/geometry and the materials/matter. I think the mother relates to matter and father to pattern.</p>
<br>

<p>The manufacturing, resource harvesting, distributing and production areas of the economy is masculine. Selling and marketing and managing of the goods is more feminine.</p>
<br>

<p>Wisdom is the root and awareness is the crown.</p>
<br>

<p>Narrow AI is an AI that plays chess or translates one language to another. This was past AI called machine learning. Current AI is already AGI I believe since it is not narrow but can be easily used in generalized ways. If tuned it will be able to use robots/physical bodies and other devices to connect to the physical/real world.(Postnote - Technically an AGI should be able to "do anything". By that I mean create images, 3d models, audio, video, video games, or anything else. So we're kinda there but only if you mash everything together. Of course then someone will continue to raise the bar higher.)</p>
<br>

<p>A UBI(Universal basic income) wont work in the west because we are a capitalist, competition based system. Basic income means basic status, hence not many men on UBI will marry. It can only work in a social climate like India, middle eastern countries and maybe rural areas of China where arranged marriage is done.</p>
<br>

<p>Find the things you don't dislike doing. Activities and practices that don't cause you resistance. Even if you aren't good at them, they are easier to learn. It's also good to know the things you're naturally good at and bad at. Sometimes we don't like doing these though.</p>
<br>

<p>Determination comes from the kidneys. I imagine this is willpower. Drive and determination too.</p>
<br>

<br>

<p>Technology turns life into more of a video game.</p>
<br>

<p>Layers of soft and hard plastics.</p>
<br>

<p>Maybe salt is the quintessence. So the salt of something is its most pure, greatest form. It can become liquid, solid, gas, lit on fire as well.</p>
<br>

<h3>6/12/25</h3>
<br>

<p>Leveling up in life is like unlocking a new world level in a Chinese gacha rpg game like Genshin or Wuwa. At first you need to quickly level up your characters, weapons and skills because all of the new level enemies are very strong, but eventually you get stronger and the previous level seems easier now.</p>
<br>

<h3>7/12/25</h3>
<br>

<p>Modern life has become physically easier but socially and mentally more difficult.</p>
<br>

<p>Making a business in the modern age is like replicating a car or something complex. Hence why most fail and why people survive off supermarket food instead of growing it like they live off a corporate job instead of making one. Truth is, most people just aren't that good.</p>
<br>

<p>Reverse engineering stuff and making it yourself just so it doesn't have a copywrite is becoming increasingly more needed I'm noticing.</p>
<br>

<h3>9/12/25</h3>
<br>

<p>Your time and energy is precious. Spend it on something important.</p>
<br>

<h3>11/12/25</h3>
<br>

<p>Infinite growth is unrealistic, the soil must be renewed.</p>
<br>

<h3>12/12/25</h3>
<br>

<p>Supposedly sulfur can break rare earth elements apart.</p>
<br>

<p>I wonder if one day I will be the judge of God, not God the judge of me.</p>
<br>

<h3>13/12/25</h3>
<br>

<p>No one really thinks about how jobs/work can burn peoples dopamine out as well.</p>
<br>

<p>Chlorides seem to act as the foundation or substance that turns things into salt the same way that silica and corundums allows things to turn into glass.</p>
<br>

<p>Winter seems to be the money time, the yin, then summer is more spiritual.</p>
<br>

<h3>16/12/25</h3>
<br>

<p>Sleeping on the left seems to heal and stimulate the physical body while on the right seems to work with the nervous system and brain.</p>
<br>

<h3>17/12/25</h3>
<br>

<p>The gods that the magician would perform rituals to are located within the organs in the body and the planets in the heavens.</p>
<br>

<h3>18/12/25</h3>
<br>

<p>We might have to go back to using giant hdds with a small ssd because of the price increase.</p>
<br>

<p>Maybe socializing is in three main parts -</p>
<p>1. Ego. This is your shield and rougher social parts. It defends you from others.</p>
<p>2. Emotions. This part allows you to connect, be empathetic, emotional, expressive.</p>
<p>3. Voice. This part lets you speak words. If you have a weak voice or bad grasp of language then even with a strong ego and emotions, you'll struggle to express yourself and ideas. It is like the meeting point of the mind and heart.</p>
<br>

<h3>19/12/25</h3>
<br>

<p>Maybe corporations are going to replicate us with AI to predict how we'll react to different products. Essentially the reason all of this money and hardware is being put into AI is probably because of how much money it could potentially make.</p>
<br> 

<h3>20/12/25</h3>
<br>

<p>I think meditation spiritually bypasses you to the head state just like stimulants and psychedelics.</p>
<br>

<p>The ability to do is probably the most important. To see something through to the end. Even if it isn't perfect.</p>
<br>

<p>Secret fire, could it be electricity causing electrochemical reactions?</p>
<br>

<p>You can grind exp in real life like in a video game. Make lots of chairs and tables or clean and fix stuff. Read to improve your knowledge. Walk to improve your walking skill and grind small amounts of exp.</p>
<br>

<p>The best way to be productive is to work all day. Your meal times are your break times. Take a longer brake around those time in order to get what you need done. Otherwise, spend your time working and getting stuff done.</p>
<br>

<p>Some people are only in your life for a short lesson and sometimes you're that person and then you move on. Don't fixate socially in certain situations.</p> 
<br>

<p>If you want to get stuff done you have to work morning till night. It's a good skill to learn. Not fun to do but it does work. Make sure to take breaks around meal times in order to not burnout.</p>
<br>

<p>Everything goes where the money is in the material world.</p>
<br>

<h3>21/12/25</h3>
<br>

<p>Adding AI into everything is like when toasters and fridges started to get wifi connectivity and LCD screens.</p>
<br>

<p>I think the law of Saturn is that you have to force things to be the way you want them to be.</p>
<br>

<h3>22/12/25</h3>
<br>

<p>I notice ChatGPT sounding more and more culturally Indian with every update. I guess depending on the data they take on is what kind of cultural form they take.</p>
<br>

<h3>24/12/25</h3>
<br>

<p>Using AI is definitely a skill. Learning to locally host and work with the frontend to produce desired results. Even with text AI, we're subconsciously learning and improving with these tools every day.</p>
<br>

<h3>25/12/25</h3>
<br>

<p>Learn to work while sick. If you're gonna be sick then at least get something done. You still need to make money and survive, make progress.</p>
<br>

<h3>26/12/25</h3>
<br>

<p>Reduce dopamine and stimulation when working to focus better.</p>
<br>

<h3>27/12/25</h3>
<br>

<p>Bash scripting/coding is underrated if you want to understand linux better and have a simple scripting tool to work with your shell.</p>
<br>

<p>Project pressure outwards to reduce internal congestion.</p>
<br>

<h3>29/12/25</h3>
<br>

<p>The upper lvl of the social level seems to be the heart, bloodflow. This seems to relate to health and clearing blocks.</p>
<br>

<h3>30/12/25</h3>
<br>

<p>Emacs for code that writes code.</p>
<br>

<p>Imagine if there was no copywrite in the west and we could make all product boxes look like gas station Chinese brand boner pills. Heaven awaits beyond.</p>
<br>

<h3>31/12/25</h3>
<br>

<p>Relax the forehead to relax your analytical side. This is probably the frontal lobe.</p>
