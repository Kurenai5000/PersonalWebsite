 <h4>1/9/25</h4>
<br>

<p>The way we heal society is by being the bigger man/woman. Have compassion but also be disciplinary or firm and proper. People are in disarray, afraid for the future, agitated. Become a leader, a gardener of society. Whether it's close personal relationships, work or out in society.</p>
<br>

<p>We're gonna build the new world and it'll be better than ever.</p>
<br>

<p>Spiritual people are the gardeners of society.</p>
<br>

<p>Super conductors are probably one key to building spacecraft.</p>
<br>

<p>Tens units are nuts. You feel a vibration where it happens.</p>
<br>

<h4>2/9/25</h4>
<br>

<p>A database is just a save file.</p>
<br>

<p>Polar and non polar solvents. Polar seemingly is less strong. Non polar is stronger.</p>
<br>

<h4>3/9/25</h4>
<br>

<p>Personal power comes from the Aires area, the head or mind. Earthly power comes from the root of the body.</p>
<br>

<h4>4/9/25</h4>
<br>

<p>Think about fixing problems rather than feeling helpless or down. If you need to go through the dark period with your feelings then do it, but then figure out an answer. If you can't, at least do something to better your life or self. Otherwise, take a step back and rest to build up stamina.</p>
<br>

<h4>5/9/25</h4>
<br>

<p>A lot of people are saying that you don't need to grind now. I don't think that's true. If anything you need to put in more work if you want to get results.
People who've already made it get lazy, rest on past achievements and speak about the peaceful state they're in. Work life balance is important, but grinding gets you results.</p>
<br>

<p>A pyramid is made up of triangles. Cube made up of squares, dodecahedron out of pentagons. A pyramids triangular face is connected by three other triangles, similarly a cubes square is connected by four squares and a dodecahedrons face is connected by five pentagons.</p>
<br>

<h4>6/9/25</h4>
<br>

<p>We have to be the ones to repair the divide and corruption in society. In our families, communities, friendships, etc.</p>
<br>

<h4>9/9/25</h4>
<br>

<p>When daoists wizards used their yang qi to resurrect someone I imagine it worked the same way a defibrillator works. Shocking people with lots of power around the heart. Similar the alchemical yang mineral drugs that they made are probably a chemical way for that. Perhaps it gives immense calories and heat to the dead.</p>
<br>

<p>I'm noticing that stuffs getting more expensive on aliex**ess to where e**y is actually becoming viable again. Then I thought "What if China starts making everything really expensive. Aren't we in the west screwed?".</p>
<p>Yeah, I think harvesting, processing and manufacturing are really important. Especially if there's any global tensions. This is a huge vulnerability that hasn't been addressed. It's a part of why things become more expensive and the quality isn't good.</p>
<br>

<h4>10/9/25</h4>
<br>

<p>Try to become more efficient in everything you do. If you can do things more efficiently and faster, you can do more things. </p>
<br>

<h4>11/9/25</h4>
<br>

<p>USB and backup protips - Cheap aliexp***s usbs and drives can be a gamble. Infact some hard drives in general can be bad. Make sure to test if your data can sit for a few months on a usb/drive before committing to it. Also, USB2 is better for backwards compatibility if that matters.</p>
<br>

<h4>12/9/25</h4>
<br>

<p>Australia is hell.</p>
<br>

<p>I looked at some bread and thought "Yep, this is definitely a video game" in my tired state. "These graphics are video game ass graphics".</p>
<br>

<p>Drugs are switches to different levels of reality. Alcohol takes you down, nicotine takes you up.</p>
<br>

<h4>14/9/25</h4>
<br>

<p>I know people wanna call for a civil war and next year the tensions will be high, but I think this gives us a good opportunity for unity. The left opened pandoras box but we don't have to let chaos destroy things. Someone has to be the bigger man, someone has to stand up for stability.</p>
<br>

<h4>16/9/25</h4>
<br>

<p>I wonder if western women are so obsessed with their career as a way to make up for self esteem issues. Jobs usually give men position in society. Women in the past didn't get their position from their career. Though men still wont respect women for having a high level career. This leads me to think that it's more of a woman v woman thing.</p>
<br>

<p>Perhaps water is a good medium or receiver because it is not solid but liquid. It is capable of movement. Hence subtle vibrations would move it.</p>
<br>

<p>I think open source is a good idea for the future because probably in the next 10 years, a lot of programs are going to become legacy and non usable anymore with operating system changes. Similar to how Mac programs usually don't work after a new OS.</p>
<br>

<p>Having programs as modules similar to how we have modern libraries that let us do certain things is an idea. So that way if someone makes something, others can use it for their project.</p>
<br>

<p>If you look at things in a lens of demons then peoples illness becomes very simple. It's a demon that controls them and makes them do bad things, become a bad person. But then what is a demon? Is it the influence of the organs? A mental or emotional influence? Other people, society and culture? Does thinking this way take responsibility away from people and overly simplify issues?</p>
<br>

<h4>17/9/25</h4>
<br>

<p>I like thinking of things to do as either a main quest or side quest. Having a text document with "stuff to do" or "stuff to buy" or maybe "major life requirements" is good. Treat life a bit more like a game maybe. That way you can just grind out your side quests when you're bored or have time.</p>
<br>

<p>I think we are going to evolve to get used to technology.</p>
<br>

<h4>19/9/25</h4>
<br>

<p>I dislike the section of the internet that overly critiques peoples story writing for being unrealistic. Write your trashy power/goonfiction with pride. Who wants to read about regular characters that are realistic by some critic fearing, imaginationless persons perspective? No one. We talk to enough NPC's on the daily to not want it in fiction. I want my female characters with legs as wide and skyscrapers and male characters with tank guns for arms. Fuck the rules, that's why Wuxia power fantasy is so popular. Stereotypes exist because they are true. Not to say you can't bring reality into a story because realism is its own form of crazy but the best stuff is made when you don't think about what others think.</p>
<br>

<p>It might be good to say the things you need to say because you might not get a chance to say them.<p/>
<br>

<h4>20/9/25</h4>
<br>

<p>Cold water gives yin energy.</p>
<br>

<h4>22/9/25</h4>
<br>

<p>Passion comes from the heart.</p>
<br>

<p>Run stuff as a company to avoid legal action against you as a person.</p>
<br>

<p>I used to think that making the product/thing was the hardest part of business. Then I learned how to make and figured out that advertising and selling is the hardest part. Now I think that the legal aspects are the most difficult. Knowing how to properly structure the business around a countries laws to avoid eventual issues.</p>
<br>

<p>Oh fuck... Everywhere is becoming India. The overpopulation issues of India are now hitting us because we have so many of them. The reason you can't drive anywhere quickly, shop fast, etc.</p>
<br>

<p>We need a fully decentralized internet to avoid corporate and government control.</p>
<br>

<h4>23/9/25</h4>
<br>

<p>If you understand society, learn business, business structure and business law. It gives you a lot of insight into why things the way they are.</p>
<br>

<p>I'm thinking about the young adult unemployment issue and thinking it might be the most important issue right now. What happens in 5-10 years when tons of people enter their 30's, having missed tons of life milestones, no house, no marriage, lack of skills and financial ability. I think solving this now is probably the most important thing that is being completely ignored.</p>
<br>

<p>Law is at the throat level.</p>
<br>

<p>Pants, especially tight ones are bad for the bladder and generative systems. Hence why women shouldn't wear them. It allows better energy from downward. Similarly, wizards wore loose fitting clothing.</p>
<br>

<p>I seem to stop caring about things and then normal people start becoming interested in them. Maybe it's like I'm one update ahead of everyone else.</p>
<br>

<h4>25/9/25</h4>
<br>

<p>Health is the foundation of everything. If your health suffers then everything does.</p>
<br>

<p>Imagine being born into a virtual world. Time accelerated in there to re-experience the whole growth phase until adulthood, into a virtual game world.
You could experience anything and gain completely new perspectives.</p>
<br>

<p>"🧠 Spinal Cord Nerve Map</p>

<p>Sensation around tailbone/anus.</p>

<p>Minor role in pelvic floor support."-ChatGPT</p>
<br>

<p>The ideas of the circulatory channels or meridians being blocked and then opening them through practice is interesting. I assume these meridians link up to the arteries, veins and nerves. Nowadays surgeons can perform surgeries to unblock or fix channels. While in the past, different exercises and herbs were used.</p> 
<br>

<h4>27/9/25</h4>
<br>

<p>Life will show you the next step to take unless you already need to work on the current step. If it doesn't show you then you can understand all of reality and yourself to divine an answer; Looking beyond the veil.</p>
<br>

<p>Focusing too hard on an area of the body seems to cause stagnation. But if you can draw the blood and energy into the organ or area it can help to build and develop it.</p>
<br>

<p>Tonify the root and kidneys. Become indestructible, immortal.</p>
<br>

<p>Thinking about everything having a "durability" or life stat like in SAO Alicisation is interesting. This would be related to the root, raw life force. When it is depleted, things break or die. Though through magical or physical arts, durability can be restored.</p>
<br>

<h4>28/9/25</h4>
<br>

<p>Is it possible to trick God?</p>
<br>

<p>Loosing your will is probably the worst thing that can happen.</p>
<br>

<h4>29/9/25</h4>
<br>

<p>Don't let plant matter collect in areas of the outer house. It ferments and rots with rain and causes other things to degrade.</p>
<br>

<p>"Irrigate" the bones, muscles and organs with blood.</p>
<br>

<p>Use your intelligence to overcome any obstacle that your other abilities cannot.</p>
<br>

<p>Saw an owl on the roof tonight, it came down near me. Such beautiful creatures. They are the only bird without severely brain deficient looking eyes.</p>
<br>

<h4>30/9/25</h4>
<br>

<p>Lungs are a yin organ in the yang part of the body.</p>
<br>

<p>Time, energy money. The three resources.</p>
<br>

<p>I had an image of both my lower, physical, work and house life connecting to my upper, internet, intellectual, internal life. That they might be able to meet in the middle.</p>
