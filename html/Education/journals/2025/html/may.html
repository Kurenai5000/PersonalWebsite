 <h4>1/5/25</h4>
<br>

<p>Career is the most important thing for a man who has not made it yet.</p>
<br>

<p>The same way women get a baby instinct, men get that for a career.</p>
<br>

 <h4>2/5/25</h4>
<br>

<p>Men fear loosing money/career, women fear loosing relationships/family. I imagine.</p>
<br>

<p>You can arrange your wardrobe into 3 major categories of clothes and accessories. Lower class, middle and upper. Upper is suits and expensive gear. Middle is what you wear usually to work or out, semi-uncomfortable clothing. Lower is comfortable clothing, fit for home. These can be mixed together for different occasions and needs.</p> 
<p>Also, learn basic color theory. Contrasts are nice if one color is duller than the primary. Similar colors usually work fine depending on the shade and intensity. Sharper fabrics work better for thinner bodies while softer work better for larger.</p>
<br>

<p>You have to squish the corporate HR or manager voice inside of you which says that something is not good enough. Overdoing things can usually make more issues than just putting something out there.</p>
<br>

<h4>3/5/25</h4>
<br>

<p>I notice that if I can feel, think and imagine a movement that I can do it with my body.</p>
<br>

<h4>4/5/25</h4>
<br>

<p>Tension and relaxation. Relaxation causes energy to go downward and develop the lower body while tension causes it to rise to the head.</p>
<br>

<p>Spicy food gives me more energy, this is how I used to do tons of creative stuff back in the day. Spicy food and stimulants.</p>
<br>

<p>People who are weakest have the greatest force of transformation.</p>
<br>

<h4>5/5/25</h4>
<br>

<p>Basic categories of clothes - casual(comfortable, loose), social(less comfortable, more fitting), work(blue collar/white collar). 
Larger categories - athletic/sports, casual, social, work, formal.</p>
<br>

<p>Emotional maturity and control is an essential skill in conducting business.</p>
<br>

<p>Respect customers, their time and money in business.</p>
<br>

<p>States and ph- Earthly(colloidal/ash) is usually alkaline, organic(oils) is neutral and acidic(usually crystaline) is acidic.</p>
<br>

<p>Cultivate so much power that a single glance of it will cause others to not even bother fighting.</p>
<br>

<h4>6/5/25</h4>
<br>

<p>Money and business exists around the sphere of society, the social world. The markets.</p>
<br>

<p>Once you understand the game of life, you can make better decisions based off that knowledge. Just like knowing how to play a favourite video game.</p>
<br>

<p>Maybe I stopped making art because I stopped living in my heart.</p>
<br>

<p>Clean the heart to enter the mind. The heart is the "gate" of "heaven"(The head).</p>
<br>

<p>Light awakens the mind. A small light in a dark room reflects a strong internal light.</p>
<br>

<p>A lack of cheap housing and available jobs are probably a big root cause of mens issues in marriage and having children.</p>
<br>

<h4>8/5/25</h4>
<br>

<p>Orgone could also be an electret. Imagine if you charged the metal inside of it while it sets.</p>
<br>

<p>Bloodflow heals. Control the bloodflow to control healing.</p>
<br>

<p>Reject the world and grind.</p>
<br>

<h4>9/5/25</h4>
<br>

<p>I think that left wing countries are in a feminine era and right are in a masculine.</p>
<br>

<p>I think cars act like capacitors. Outer metal shell, plastic interior. They charge you with electrostatic.</p>
<br>

<p>Webp is actually a good file format if you want to save space on websites. Image viewer programs are still catching up, hence why it opens in a web browser, so don't write it off too soon.</p>
<br>

<p>Do everything in batches to get stuff done faster.</p>
<br>

<h4>10/5/25</h4>
<br>

<p>Focusing on the front of the head seems to calm visions and front of throat to calm phantom voices.</p>
<br>

<p>A cam wheel ensouls action into an automaton. Randomness is perhaps the prime cam that ensouls the world. This is then filtered and refined to create personality, mindstate. Infinity into limited actions which fit the person.</p>
<br>

<h4>11/5/25</h4>
<br>

<p>I've noticed in the past year that the road has gotten increasingly more stressful, even though I get better. I think society in general can seen of this way. Life increasingly gets worse. I don't understand how new or young people can live. Will we hit a climax moment of difficulty where things have to get easier? Or will life just stagnate more?</p>
<br>

<p>Clearing the top of the head seems to remove fear.</p>
<br>

<p>Use a business email and a different email for contacts. Even a different email for anything that handles money.</p>
<br>

<p>For Japanese. Kun-yomi is meaning. Onyomi is a reading.</p>
<br>

<h4>12/5/25</h4>
<br>

<p>Seems like when you're in the lower class, men start to be agressive and mean to you, then in the middle class, women do. I wonder what happens in the upper classes?</p>
<br>

<p>Society feels like it's constantly getting more intense.</p>
<br>

<h4>13/5/25</h4>
<br>

<p>I think impostor syndromes cause is having a weak lower half in the body, a weak root. Assuming you're not actually bad.</p>
<br>

<p>If you aren't working yourself to the bone and beyond in this era then it's not enough. We don't have the luxuries of 40-60 years ago. Work will amount to nothing, hard work to something, very hard work to more.</p>
<br>

<p>If I can learn to work quicker then I might be able to catch up to others my own age. More work done today means less tomorrow. If I can do it right and retain the knowledge well then I can accelerate.</p>
<br>

<h4>14/5/25</h4>
<br>

<p>UBI is like financial methadone. It doesn't work and creates a dependent population.</p>
<br>

<p>There will be no UBI to save you and AI wont replace you. You still have to work, study, train, eat, sleep, shit, etc. Technology will advance, society will change but your inner self will always be the same.</p>
<br>

<p>Find inner stability but be flexible enough to adjust to changes and don't be weak because of external forces.</p>
<br>

<p>Text seems to work in a modern endless scroll format but pictures suffer like in Korean Manhwa. Perhaps information density is key for endless scrolling of a web format instead page format.</p>
<br>

<h4>16/5/25</h4>
<br>

<p>If people knew their thoughts and feelings had a real effect on the people and world around them, they'd have to start taking responsibility for these faculties.</p>
<br>

<p>Failure is the way you learn. We must create environments which allow and buffer for failure.</p>
<br>

<p>I think mass manufactured synthetic stuff is actually a good idea. It needs to be made safe for health and more robust/durable. I imagine with 3D printing and other advancements that each country or even person can make all their own stuff they need out of cheap metamaterials(Plastics).</p>
<br>

<p>Companies are the masculine and workers are the feminine. Resources and land are feminine.</p>
<br>

<p>Health and healing comes from directing blood and energy through the body. This heals troubled areas. Similarly. If the body is weak, you can tonify or strengthen it through exercises that increase blood and energy. General muscle and cardio training helps.</p>
<br>

<p>The clothes you wear stimulate different organs depending on the colors. Similarly, natural vs unnatural fabrics have an effect. Unnatural and tighter are more positive while loose natural fabrics are negative.</p>
<br>

<p>Making drugs that cause illness like effects could be a way to understand the illness and then create a remedy or antidote.</p>
<br>

<h4>17/5/25</h4>
<br>

<p>The maid waifubot will be the next great home appliance.</p>
<br>

<p>The same way that a camshaft and timing belt controls timing of an engine, opening and closing the valves which regulates pressure, the stars are the time controller of the earth. They control energetic phenomena which then influences physical phenomena.</p>
<br>

<p>I wonder if the torii gate of a shrine represent the heart. Entering to the sacred land of the head through the heart/red gate.</p>
<br>

<h4>18/5/25</h4>
<br>

<p>Older cultures seem to use the word "spirit" for I think the mind. They say when the mind is pure or healthy then the body will be too.</p>
<br>

<p>No one seems to wear white. It feels good to wear, like you are powerful. White relates to the lungs and heavens in TCM, to moral uprightness. I think people who are corrupted struggle to wear or be around whiteness.</p>
<br>

<p>See your environment as a place to learn to survive and thrive in. While it's manmade and isn't the natural world of last era, it is the land you must learn.</p>
<br>

<p>I tried as hard as I could, worked as hard, strategised, etc and I still fucked my life up.</p>
<br>

<h4>19/5/25</h4>
<br>

<p>I think it's better to teach people to help themselves or give them opportunities to do it then to do things for them.</p>
<br>

<p>Agility and graceful movement is the trait of venusian people.</p>
<br>

<p>When you're low status as a man, women completely ignore you, then when you're slightly higher, they show disgust. So eventually they will be neutral?(Postnote - I'm kind of at that point now. Seems so.)</p> 
<br>

<h4>20/5/25</h4>
<br>

<p>Combustion engines rely on air pressure and vacuums to function. The explosions only function really is to create that air pressure which then moves a thing to create rotational force.</p>
<br>

<p>I had an idea of a combustion chamber motor which then had a second chamber connected to a flat, wide turbine wheel spinner. I imagine lighter "pistons" or "spinners" will create more speed while heavier ones will make more torque/strength. Of course this could be geared up or down. But spinning a turbine really fast would be cool.</p>
<br>

<p>Magic circuits, certain patterns made with different materials having electromagnetic effects. I guess that's why people call printed circuits like cpus similar to occultic symbols.</p>
<br>

<p>Anyone who sells you on mindset is scamming you.</p>
<br>

<h4>21/5/25</h4>
<br>

<p>Your time is precious, don't waste any of it.</p>
<br>

<p>Western and European countries now need to out China China. The same way Chinese manufacturers would replicate and reverse engineer Western/European goods, Western manufacturers who will begin starting from 0 will need to do the same with current Chinese goods.</p>
<br>

<p>It would be interesting to know how sound effects the air and weather.</p>
<br>

<h4>22/5/25</h4>
<br>

<p>Silicone filament for 3D printers would be cool. I've tried TPU which is a polyurethane, but it isn't rubbery enough for soft applications like robot skin. It's more like a tough, shock resistant, slightly rubbery hunk of plastic. Think urethane skateboard wheels. 
People use 3d printing to make silicone molds.</p>
<br>

<h4>23/5/25</h4>
<br>

<p>If you suck the air out of a jar but the space inside still exists, what is inside the jar?</p>
<br>

<p>Symbolism of a red rose dripping red liquid probably is the quintessence dripping out of the plasma when creating a metallic oil.</p>
<br>

<p>The west has been funding a genocide against middle easterners for 20+ years and we're going to have to live with the guilt and consequences of it in the next 20. I don't think we realize once the dust settles how fucked we are on an international relations level.</p>
<br>

<p>One way to think about learning is that unknown things become known. Things you had to do consciously before now become subconscious. This frees up your conscious abilities to be able to do new stuff.</p>
<br>

<h4>24/5/25</h4>
<br>

<p>I kind of want to psiOp health influences into eating dog food for gainz.</p>
<br>

<p>Analyzing the entire world, all things and everyone. Understanding and breaking down everything into raw archetypes. Knowing the connections between them, the cycles and flow and interactions.</p>
<br>

<h4>25/5/25</h4>
<br>

<p>It seems to be more common that older men are always jacked up on some kind of steroid or testosterone. I think this is a problem because it makes your energy like that of a young man again. You're not meant to be that way when you get older. These guys seem to just spend all their time jacking off or addicted to porn. As you get older, that volatile, fiery energy transforms into a slower, stabler form which allows you to work better, be more constructive and practical. I don't see that with a lot of older men who take these enhancers.</p>
<br>

<p>I imagine first world countries that base their economy in housing will experience braindrain. These countries are prioritizing GDP over technological innovation and scientific research. Essentially prioritizing the lower over the higher which ironically causes the citizens to lack the "lower" things like housing, food, goods, etc.</p>
<br>

<p>PLA even PLA+ doesn't seem the best for industrial uses, anything that requires heat or outdoor uses unless coated in paints and resins. PETG is probably better to use. Though PLA does work for some internal and inside uses.</p>
<p>Prototyping with PLA is fine.<p>
<br>

<p>You shouldn't smell bad unless you're ill.</p>
<br>

<p>Modern medicine relies on a destructive approach. Remove the bad thing, kill the bad thing. Instead, it needs to learn a constructive or healing approach. To help the body heal, to circulate, to facilitate the environment which allows for health and regeneration.</p>
<br>

<p>The chemical state is above that of mechanical. Mechanical relates to lower frequency and then chemical to middle maybe.</p>
<br>

<h4>26/5/25</h4>
<br>

<p>I wonder if the voltage in electrolysis dictates the chemical gained.(Postnote - Seemingly higher wattages stop the metals from oxidizing and degrading. Instead they seem to give off more gas.)</p>
<br>

<p>I think there's a link between dust and electrostatic energy. At least it might control or direct dust/lint.(Look into air ionizers. Supposedly they cause dust and air particles to stick to the walls once ionized. Don't run them for long though, the ozone in excess is bad for you.)</p>
<br>

<p>Money is like blood circulating through a business or country. The same way blood builds your body, turning into it's physical matter, money gains material things or makes stuff happen.</p>
<br>

<p>One thing I'm finding is that you have to get comfortable with learning. I wish I could know everything and just be able to do whatever I want, but I like doing lots of things which means I need to learn tons of new things. So, if you catch yourself being frustrated at learning, try to relax and accept it.</p>
<br>

<h4>27/5/25</h4>
<br>

<p>Preservation of knowledge is important. Website, videos, books, etc. Physical or digital.</p>
<br>

<p>You use your addictive personality/traits for your work or studies.</p>
<br>

<p>All programs or collections of code are like virtual entities. That is the raw material, the body perhaps of the program.</p>
<br>

<p>We have free will but are limited by our environments and current bodies, resources, etc.</p>
<br>

<h4>28/5/25</h4>
<br>

<p>Saturn just entered Aries the other day. This means we're officially in the new cycle at the spring period. It will retrograde soon so it wont be "solid" for another near year, around next year late February.</p>
<br>

<p>I imagine the kidneys cause growth in the body. A kidney dominant person will have thick hair and nails.</p>
<br>

<h4>29/5/25</h4>
<br>

<p>Wire turns x amps = magnetic field strength.</p>
<br>

<p>Learn the mathematical formulas for life.</p>
<br>

<h4>30/5/25</h4>
<br>

<p>Maths and formulas for fields of practice probably shouldn't be prioritized until the student is at least at an intermediate or higher level. They're more of a higher level way to understand thing. Raw practical experience is far better for a learning student.</p>
<br>

<p>Dealing in absolutes lets you see reality for what it is.</p>
<br>

<h4>31/5/25</h4>
<br>

<p>I notice that the zoomers lack spacial awareness. They struggle with processing objects in 3d space and objects moving around them. Probably a kind of mild autism/sensory disorder. I think physical exercise and meditation might help.</p>
<br>

<p>Is an algorithm a mathematical formula? Understand the values/data and then figure out the formula for how it works.</p>
<br>

<p>I look forward to having a wife the same way that now I don't look at cars and feel the need to have one cause I already do. Money is probably the same. All these material things when not satisfied screw you up, hence why older cultures have arrange marriage and give men jobs from a younger age. Essentially satisfying their physical desires which if not, become chaotic.(Unfulfilled desire really is the root of suffering.)</p>
<br>

<p>Being trading partners is a good way to make a stable relationship between countries or companies.</p>
<br>

<p>Formulas are the closest things we have to cheat codes for life.</p>
