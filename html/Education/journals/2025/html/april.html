 <h4>1/4/25</h4>
<br>

<p>Water - Regeneration, fertility</p>
<p>Wood - Ego, self respect</p>
<p>Fire - Creativity, spirituality</p>
<p>Metal - Intellect, Morality</p>
<p>Earth - Money, stability</p>
<br>

<p>I want to learn to use my mind to do whatever I want. To gain supreme mental power.</p>
<br>

<p>The metal element is linked to electricity in tcm.</p>
<br>

<h4>3/4/25</h4>
<br>

<p>Turns out not writing with a pen for ages makes it difficult to write.</p>
<br>

<p>I think the world needs more empathy, but not in excess.</p>
<br>

<p>Seemingly when men are young, they struggle getting relationships. Now around 50% of women after around 30 I believe are not in a relationship. So it shifts for the genders after around 30.</p>
<br>

<p>We start off in a cell or enclosed space and as we grow up that space becomes larger. It starts in a room then becomes a house, neighborhood, city, country, etc as you gain power.</p>
<br>

<p>The body is a prison, a limitation of the soul. All of these limitations exist to give a physical, material form. Without it, we wouldn't have existence. The soul then is the will which acts upon the body.</p>
<br>

<h4>4/4/25</h4>
<br>

<p>I think plastic will replace glass for most applications where glass is still used like windows in buildings and vehicles.</p>
<br>

<p>Seemingly anything of the mineral kingdom conducts electricity and anything organic repels or insulates. This is just a generalization but it's something to think about. The earth below us is like an electrically conductive world, but then the organic stuff seems more to work off stuff like electrostatics maybe? Since organic materials seem to give electrostatic and plastics take it. Then you can think that most of anything underground can be made into batteries or electromagnetic technology. Who knows if organics could also be used in interesting ways beyond just insulation, dielectric separation, etc.</p>
<br>

<p>Speaking is interesting. Imagine if animals could speak human language. Now that a computer can, people start to see intelligence in it and humanize it.</p>
<br>

<p>2040 will be the start of the golden age or solar period of this phase when Saturn and Jupiter are in Libra. Currently we are going to go through the morning or spring period.</p>
<br>

<p>Maybe the conversations you have with AI's are like a direct reflection of you. Not everyone will get the same answers back.</p>
<br>

<h4>5/4/25</h4>
<br>

<p>One thing to do for buying used vehicles is instantly replace the battery, fluids, lights, airfilters and sparkplugs.</p>
<br>

<p>You can change the oil less often for synthetic oil, 10,000-15,000km or 8k-10k for semi-synthetic.</p>
<br>

<p>Hardware or processing power is like the lower or more material, negative power of pcs and then internet speed is the more spiritual or positive part. So you can either improve processing power/hardware to render and calculate or you can increase transfer rate and let a server handle it.</p>
<br>

<h4>6/4/25</h4>
<br>

<p>Leg training is all foundation, running and horse stance.</p>
<br>

<p>A circles diameter is circumference/pi. Pi is around 3.14. Then the opposite would be diameter * pi to get circumference.</p>
<p>Radius is also half of the diameter or diameter/2 and diameter from radius is radius * 2.</p>
<br>

<p>In astrology each sign has 30 degrees and each degree has 60 minutes of arc(Like cents or mini degrees).</p>
<br>

<p>Capacitive filtering -</p>
<p>0.1µF (100nF): Kills high-frequency noise (WiFi/radio interference).</p>
<p>10µF: Handles lower-frequency hum (50/60Hz AC).
-DeepSeek</p>
<br>

<p>The old idea of communing with demons to gain forbidden knowledge has interesting parallels with talking to AI's.</p>
<br>

<h4>7/4/25</h4>
<br>

<p>I hear that if a magnetic field moves it becomes an electric field, if an electric field is still, it is a magnetic field.</p>
<br>

<p>I can't help but think that the scientific community is more interested in keeping their reputation and social status instead of pioneering and developing the field in fear of loosing their peers respect. Now, relate that to other fields like business, politics, education, who knows what else is stagnant because people want to just keep up the status quo.</p>
<br>

<h4>8/4/25</h4>
<br>

<p>I still think VR is the third and next level of tech. Experiential tech. First is audio-text like phones, radio, terminal computers. Second is visual and semi interactive like smart phones, web pages, 3d games, modern pcs.</p>
<p>To get it rolling we need to manufacture cheap headsets and have linux compatible, stable software. When it is linux compatible and open source, then it can be ported to mobile which will drive it to the masses. Then it'll take off.</p>
<br>

<p>Dematerialise physical things with software/websites. That's a way to make a good app/program/site.
Turn a calculator into an app, a clock into a program. A form into a website.</p>
<br>

<p>Seemingly in the 1700's electrostatic devices like electrostatic batteries (capacitors) and electrostatic motors and spark gaps where some of the first electrical devices before magnetism was combined into the field.</p>
<br>

<p>Big tech companies are ungrounded, they don't understand the regular person so they release things with too many features or too over designed and people don't care about paying the extra when probably it would be better to just maximise units sold.</p>
<br>

<p>Women are a physical representation of the culture or society in a physical form.</p>
<br>

<p>You can make bricks with metals in them and gems. This might act like an orgonite thingo, try it out. Then you can meditate on it. This is a capacitor or condensor of "spiritual energies". Arrays or patterns might've been made in the past with bricks like this.</p>
<br>

<p>Computers need metal cases to shield from emf.</p>
<br>

<p>Look up the idea of psychedelics using/ depleting rare elements in the brain.</p>
<br>

<p>Maybe the use of sulfur in elxirs is used to dissolve the substance. Sublimating with sulfur or distilling it with sulfur might work to dissolve the substance.</p>
<br>

<p>Water seems to relay or allow thoughts to connect through it. A thought antenna.</p>
<br>

<h4>9/4/25</h4>
<br>

<p>Countries need to reindustrialise in order to fight a war.</p>
<br>

<p>Pigs have big balls.</p>
<br>

<h4>10/4/25</h4>
<br>

<p>Intelligence increases the vividness and scope of your experience.</p>
<br>

<h4>12/4/25</h4>
<br>

<p>Ultra sound helmet for neuromodulation.(Postnote - Ultrasound was recently used to create virtual smell. So maybe this isn't a longshot.)</p>
<br>

<p>Turns out lower voltage(12v) systems don't scale very well. Do the math when you want to make a solar system. I imagine 48v is probably a sweet spot since any more voltage is dangerous for DC.</p>
<br>

<h4>13/4/25</h4>
<br>

<p>Customer service or how good you are socially to the other person is more important than we might think.</p>
<br>

<h4>14/4/25</h4>
<br>

<p>Some plastics are a little bit like bone.</p>
<br>

<h4>15/4/25</h4>
<br>

<p>Release the fear of the future. If AI takes your job then get a new one. Learn to accelerate your intelligence beyond technology in order to see beyond the horizon. Fear makes you complacent. Study and develop yourself. Build yourself up for the future. Learn to become flexible and see things for how they are. TLDR - Grow some balls and take control of your life instead of letting external advancements bum you out, no matter how hard it might be.</p>
<br>

<p>Break things down as much as you can. Make sure the little bits work. Do it line by line, step by step. Then you can add more, then you can make it larger. In coding, put a print debug statement to track every movement of a variable, every if, loop and function entering if you need it.</p>
<br>

<p>You can use radio to detect devices. Drones or phones would be in the 2.4ghz, radio in the mhz.</p>
<br>

<p>For databases/servers - Create, read, update, delete.</p>
<p>POST to create, GET to read, PUT to update, DELETE to remove.</p>
<br>

<p>Software radio devices look fun to play around with.</p>
<br>

<p>Do more hard stuff then hard stuff isn't so hard anymore.</p>
<br>

<p>Mechanical engineering, electrical engineering and programming seemingly are the fundamentals of the creation of technology. Science and mathematics are the two guiding stars of these fields letting you hypothesize and understand scope and amount of reality.</p>
<br>

<p>Technology is usually created out of inorganic or processed organic materials.</p>
<br>

<h4>16/4/25</h4>
<br>

<p>Supposedly women with bigger boobs are more nurturing. I need to get me a big boobed woman.</p>
<br>

<h4>17/4/25</h4>
<br>

<p>Water always stays level. You could use it to make measuring devices for rotation.</p>
<br>

<p>You can use circuit breaker switches as ghetto switches for AC circuits if you're afraid of shorting the circuit out. Also remembering that as long as your circuit is a circle, or everything connected in a circle without any shorts that it should be fine.</p>
<p>Low power inverters are safer ways to test AC circuits without fear of shorting your home. Do be mindful if the inverter is a sinewave one or not.</p>
<br>

<p>Blue/Black wire is neutral. Brown/Red is A or power wire, Green/Yellow stripe is E or ground.</p>
<br>

<p>Chinese mastered cooking from a raw physics perspective. They figured out how to cook things in every different way, boiling, steaming, oil, air frying(grilling). Looking into their food is good to learn new cooking methods.</p>
<br>

<h4>18/4/25</h4>
<br>

<p>Things that are mechanical feel more simple and stable, reliable.</p>
<br>

<p>1.5mm = 15amp (Lighting)</p>
<p>2.5mm = 20amp (sockets)</p>
<p>4mm = 30amp (High power, laundry)</p>
<p>6mm = 40amp (Very high power, kitchen)</p>
<br>

<h4>19/4/25</h4>
<br>

<p>Length of antenna determines the frequency is can receive. Longer antenna receives lower frequency, shorter receives higher.</p>
<br>

<p>I think in 10-20 years people will look at modern JavaScripts esoteric syntax like they did assembly and unmaintained Fortran code that old systems use. Maybe it's like sawing off legs or using leeches in old medicine. Either way this syntax is nonsense.</p>
<br>

<h4>20/4/25</h4>
<br>

<p>Basic home electrical components. Breakers, switches(dimmers), power sockets, light sockets, cables.</p>
<br>

<p>I think green is the color of Germany, related to earth. Red for Italy which is Fire.</p>
<br>

<h4>21/4/25</h4>
<br>

<p>You can circulate pressure through the body by breathing in. That creates pressure with the air.</p>
<br>

<h4>22/4/25</h4>
<br>

<p>Anger is a defense mechanism for weakness and sometimes shame.</p>
<br>

<p>Use the organ related to the element to control the element.</p>
<br>

<p>Use the water element/organ to heal the body or reduce inflammation.</p>
<br>

<h4>24/4/25</h4>
<br>

<p>Face the darkness within you and the world. Learn to handle it without shying away and hiding.</p>
<br>

<h4>26/4/25</h4>
<br>

<p>Think of something you're able to do on a pc, then make a website/socialmedia/business around it.</p>
<br>

<h4>27/4/25</h4>
<br>

<p>Test two metals in an electrolyte to test their electrochemistry.</p>
<br>

<p>Energizing the legs seems to restore libido and stamina.</p>
<br>

<p>Once robot humanoids are perfected in the next couple years you could upscale it 5-10x and make a controllable mecha suit like in Gundam. It'd work on the same technology of motor actuators and sensors.</p>
<br>

<p>Not knowing something can be scary. When you understand and have enough experience in something it no longer is scary anymore. Exposure therapy helps to conquer fears.</p>
<br>

<h4>28/4/25</h4>
<br>

<p>If you sit in meditation the internal organs seem to go through a certain process. The energy in the body gathers and changes from one organ to another, working with the essences/fluids of that organ. This is the process of internal alchemy. It seems to start with stimulating the kidneys to generate urine in the bladder which then stimulates the generative center(prostate/womb). Eventually once that area is satisfied the energy "pull" moves to the heart, then head. After the head it moves to the throat region.</p>
<br>

<h4>29/4/25</h4>
<br>

<p>Women are very sensitive to the social level. The way someone dresses, acts, speaks, their social status, the feeling they put off, etc.</p>
<br>

<p>Tradesmen and guys in trucks seem to give off really bad energy that causes bad luck. I think because of their self destructive living habits.</p>
<br>

<h4>30/4/25</h4>
<br>

<p>Knowledge and wisdom is a burden, but it's one I'm willing to bear.</p>
