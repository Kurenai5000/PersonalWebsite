<p>Sitting and focusing outward to the flesh body helps to develop it. I think the inner organs can't be properly cultivated until the outer body is strengthened. It's like the inner organs make the energy and matter to then be delivered to the outer body. Either way the flesh body is a shell which protects us from the world. Enhancing it will enhance defense.</p>

<p>"The flowers of" in alchemy meant the sublimated crystal or crystalline acid if organic I believe.(Postnote - It looks like flowers of plasma as it sublimates then crystalline flowers as it coagulates.)</p>

<p>I'm seeing everything as a grinding hierarchy like online games. I'm kinda bored of hierarchies.</p>

<br>

<p>What if you learn to build a life and work without much money. Figure out how to go outside the system.</p>
<br>

<p>Blue lights restore mana/mental enrgy. So then red restores stamina/physical energy?</p>
<br>

<h4>3/11/25</h4>
<br>

<p>Get to a point where you don't care about enemies or other people trying to act hostile towards you. Your own life is more important.</p>

<br>

<p>"God will sell us all things at the price of labor/work." -Davinci</p>
<br>

<h4>5/11/25</h4>
<br>

<p>The first step to making money is probably to open a shop(place to sell products/services. Physical or virtual).</p>
<br>

<h4>6/11/25</h4>
<br>

<p>Vape batteries are good for electronics projects if you want to scrap them. Better reused instead of being improperly disposed of.</p>
<br>

<p>It's possible the crude oil in the earth could of been made from algae and other organic fermentation.</p>
<br>

<h4>7/11/25</h4>
<br>

<p>Time, Resource, Energy, Work, Money, Attention(social power),  Intelligence, Focus. These are the raw things that you can use to do things. They can also transmute into one another at differing exchange rates.</p>
<br>

<h4>8/11/25</h4>
<br>

<p>When you're working with a bunch of AI and machines it almost becomes a social experience where you need to learn how these things work best and how to work with them. I imagine it's similar to delegating workers tasks.</p>
<br>

<h4>10/11/25</h4>
<br>

<p>The old daoist way of immortality is to gather the lower essence and return it to the brain. I wonder if this only retains the brain and nervous system, not body. Maybe in those days they didn't have as many attacks on the physical body?</p>
<br>

<p>The kidneys are the foundation for the middle world, the torso and arms. So they stabilize and act as a base for this area. They are the base of personality in a way then.</p>
<br>

<p>"Chinese timekeeping uses the sexagenary cycle (六十甲子) — a repeating sequence of 60 combinations of:</p>
<p>Ten Heavenly Stems (天干): 甲 乙 丙 丁 戊 己 庚 辛 壬 癸</p>
<p>Twelve Earthly Branches (地支): 子 丑 寅 卯 辰 巳 午 未 申 酉 戌 亥" -ChatGPT</p>

<h4>11/11/25</h4>
<br>

<p>"According to the Treatise of the Central Yellow Master (中黃子服食節度), medicines that cure disease should be taken before eating, while medicines that nourish life should be taken after eating." -Baopuzi, I believe</p>
<br>

<h4>12/11/25</h4>
<br>

<p>Compressive(Pushing on the object), tension(pulling), torsion(twisting), bending(curving), shearing(Pushing/pulling of layers).</p>
<br>

<p>I think the heart/fire relates to the upper head, brain area. Maybe the metal element relates to the throat, lungs and lower head/jaw. Then the stomach/earth element relate to the mid body, the upper belly, lower chest. The water element would relate to the lower body, genitals-bladder area. So then assumably the wood element would relate to the lower belly? Or would it be the lower torso and the earth be the belly?</p>
<br>

<p>The fusion of the 5 elements is learning to combine the 5 organ elements in the torso area. Heart, lungs, stomach, liver and kidneys. Harmonize and heal them. This seems to be the second level after doing lower yin work, building jing in the dan tien, sinking it to the root to build sexual essences and restore the base of the body.</p>
<p>That would make the third level "ascension" in the head, doing exercises there to heal the brain and activate hidden senses or something.</p>
<p>Then in external alchemy the alchemists would mix 5 minerals together with some other chemical and liquids to refine it and sublimate or heat them in a reactor container. This emulated that process and when they ate the elixir it gave them immortality.</p>
<p>The inner elixir is "firing" or refining the 5 inner organs and using the lower material like "jing" as the base and maybe upper mind as the catalyst? The body is the reactor/vessel(salt in western alchemy), mind is the fire(sulfur?), lower essences is the water(mercury in western maybe) and organs are the elements.</p>

<p>"Ethereal Soul (Hun) – Liver – Responsible for sleep, plans, projects, life aims, “coming and going of Shen”</p>
<p>Corporeal Soul (Po) – Lung – Responsible for physiological activities, sensations, sight, hearing, smell, taste, ‘entering and exiting of Jing’</p>
<p>Intellect (Yi) – Spleen – Responsible for thinking, memory, concentration</p>
<p>Will-power (Zhi) – Kidney – Responsible for will-power, drive, determination</p>
<p>Mind (Shen) – Heart – Responsible for consciousness, thinking, affections, memory, sleep"-Probably ChatGPT</p>

<h4>17/11/25</h4>
<br>

<p>Seems you have to clear and strengthen the 5 organs to develop emotional resilience to be able to then go up to the head because you will be attacked by memories and bad thoughts that will drain your energy. So the lower areas are the resources. Middle is the emotions. Upper is probably the dao and yin/yang.</p>
<br>

<p>Springs are large circular pieces of coiled plastic with an outer connector and inner. The inner is able to spin and be rotated with a key. You make a turner with a ratchet like a bike so you can turn the spring but not the gear connected to. Then when released, it turns the main mover gear.</p>

<h4>19/11/25</h4>
<br>

<p>Two inductors in series increase inductance so 100mH +100mH = 200. In parallel it decreases it so 100+100 = 50.</p>
<p>Capacitors do the oposite so 100pf+100pf in parallel = 200pf while 100+100 in series = 50pf.</p>
<br>

<p>You can only transmit physical things so quickly. The speed of light is supposedly the limit. But data can be transferred quicker. If we could convert things to data then you could do it faster.</p>

<p>I'm thinking that local hosting AI's is probably good if you want to generate 3d models, video, audio and images on mass. Looks like you more or less need 16-24gb of VRAM with a modern graphics card, 32GB of ram and a modern CPU. About 2k in computing costs, give or take. I do wonder how quickly we'll get next gen GPU's that are made specifically for AI purposes.</p>
<br>

<p>If you can mentally structure things and then use AI to fill in the gaps you can prototype stuff really quickly. Then hone in on the details to refine.</p>
<br>

<h4>23/11/25</h4>
<br>

<p>The lower mind is the metal element, this is your chest, throat and jaw. It related to language, systems and speech. It is commonly what we call "intelligence". The upper mind is the fire element, your senses and brain. This is related to spirituality, creativity, inspiration, energy and motivation.
<p>Focus on one of them if you have trouble. You'd normally think focusing and working with the brain would help with words and computer stuff, but seemingly the chest and throat helps more.</p>
<br>

<h4>24/11/25</h4>
<br>

<p>In Asia, the dominant areas are Australia for the south, China for the East, Asian Russia for the north, India for the west.</p>
<br>

<p>Sex relates to water, the lower part of the body. Some people get stuck here. Food relates to the next area or next two.</p>
<br>

<p>A persons politics can just be an expression of their biology.</p>
<br>

<p>Spirituality, imagination and creativity is the higher mind. Math, logic, language an systems is the lower mind.</p>
<br>

<h4>25/11/25</h4>
<br>

<p>What if 3rd worlders were "bread" as bio weapons and slaves for the first world.</p>
<br>

<p>Technology, data, science is becoming "god". It is taking the place of the divine and cosmic. We are seeing metal and as fire, the sky for the sun. Hence the connection to a higher force in our world is being misguided and directed to an improper way. But another view is that we're building a "tower to god/heaven". From the ground up through a technological way we perhaps are bridging the gap between the world of man, the earthly world to the world of the divine.</p>

<p>Anime characters look a bit like they're made of plastic.</p>
<br>

<p>With copywrite laws its not legal to sell fan made stuff from different media. I really wish they were less strict and allowed for it. People still break it on mass but I'm too paranoid to.</p>
<br>

<p>"A demon makes itself look beautiful to deceive humans, an angel makes itself look scary to ward away evil."</p>

<h4>28/11/25</h4>
<br>

<p>Technically there is no up and down with computer code but just left to right. Even matrices are just left to right in a way, making artificial up and down.</p>
<br>

<h4>30/11/25</h4>
<br>

<p>10 spirits, shi shen(十神)</p>
<p>In bazi, depending on your day master will depend on what the other elements are called. The supporting element or element that transforms into the day master is called the mother or support. The element that the day master transforms into is the child or power. The element that the day master controls is wealth. The element that controls the day master is official or ally I think.</p>
