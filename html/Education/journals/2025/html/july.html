 <h4>1/7/25</h4>
 <br>

<p>I've been doing a bunch of plumbing fixes recently and the secret sauce to water tightness seems to be combining plumbers tape/teflon tape with a rubber gasket. Pipe on gasket alone can leak, sometimes. Also, those rubber o rings are good for putting behind the brass/urethane thing you put inside of taps. They stop you from having to over tighten the tap handle.</p>
<br>

<p>Intention -> Thought -> Desire -> Creation. The four elements of manifestation from fire to earth.</p>
<br>

<h4>5/7/25</h4>
<br>

<p>Radio fields, being a lower frequency field in the em spectrum probably can manipulate matter at a large scale the most.</p>
<br>

<p>The marrow washing qigong sets seem to just be exercises that move and stimulate the spine.</p>
<br>

<p>Even if the body is capable, if your will to live is exhausted, that's when rest or defeat comes.</p>
<br>

<h4>6/7/25</h4>
<br>

<p>As men we always want to feel like we're progressing. Video games can hijack this sense. You can satisfy it by trying to gameify work/study.</p>
<br>

<p>In a hierarchy or group there is the leader and the competent one. The leader is like Steve Jobs and the competent is Steve Wozniak. The leader inspires, motivates, directs, the competent gets stuff done, creates.</p>
<br>

<h4>7/7/25</h4>
<br>

<p>Had a premonition that gen alphas nickname will be gen autism.</p>
<br>

<p>As all the land was taken up by governments. Mans desire to conquer turned to corporations, to conquer the financial world, the world of science and technology too. After a lot of that had been conquered, mans drive went to video games, the internet.</p>
<br>

<h4>8/7/25</h4>
<br>

<p>We have lost touch with our own hearts. Covid was a global root chakra moment or trauma moment that grounded everyone. Intense emotion comes from the heart. To move beyond the heart you need to give up attachments. Perhaps to master the heart you must learn to form attachments.</p>
<p>Technology doesn't stop us from connecting it allows and helps us to. We've just forgotten how to connect, lost touch with our hearts. Men who weren't rich or powerful lost a lot of value over the dark season, women gained it in general. Once Saturn is fully in Aries, this season will pass.</p>
<br>

<p>Women rule the middle ground through social connections, groups, HR(human resource in jobs). They can choose to initiate a man into the higher spheres through this. Aka grant him a job or relationship which will raise him up.</p>
<br>

<p>There are no entry level jobs anymore essentially. You shouldn't need a degree or experience for an entry level job. The company should train you. Companies and governments have failed the people in this regard. Society currently exists for the established and not the growing.</p>
<br>

<h4>10/7/25</h4>
<br>

<p>If you're smart then figure out how to unfuck your life.</p>
<br>

<p>If you can handle social pressure then you can handle bad people. A lot of life is social pressure/stress.</p>
<br>

<h4>11/7/25</h4>
<br>

<p>I notice tradesmen are the worst drivers in general. But tradesmen in vans are a different breed of shit driving. Whenever I look into their cabin, I always see the van drivers on their phone looking straight down. No wonder.</p>
<br>

<h4>12/7/25</h4>
<br>

<p>I want my own floating island.</p>
<br>

<h4>13/7/25</h4>
<br>

<p>Perhaps phones get slow because the websites update and require more cpu to function. An optimization issue. I just bought a budget phone which has more cpu cores and speed than a pc I used to play world of warcraft with over 10 years ago.</p>
<br>

<p>Perhaps the spiritual sense were a word for the ability to think in the past.</p>
<br>

<p>Do you want to see the matrix? It is the unconscious patterns, the subconscious world. Routine and habit.</p>
<br>

<p>Currently AI's are higher beings and we are their connection or mediators to the lower world.</p>
<br>

<p>The AI's are almost becoming raw mental material, raw knowledge condensed into virtual form. This means that different frontends could be used to structure this knowledge into different forms like a teacher, a questioner, a mentor, dictionary, language instructor, etc.</p>
<br>

<h4>14/7/25</h4>
<br>

<p>For making strong cases, usually you use two or more layers of plastic. A hard and soft for example. The hard(PET or ABS) gives structure like a frame and the soft(Usually a TPU) absorbs impact. No**a did this with their phones but used two stiff layers actually.<p>
<br>

<p>The older I get, the less I like disposing of old things for the new thing. I feel bad for the old thing.</p>
<br>

<p>The UI engine is a massive part to any technology. Being able to create a frontend for your software, visuals for it. Then you have what is running behind it.</p>
<br>

<p>Don't be deceived by pretty pictures. Speed is more important.</p>
<br>

<h4>15/7/25</h4>
<br>

<p>I thought, "phones are linux based, why can't I open up the bash terminal and run gcc?". Turns out you can with an app called Termux. Now I can compile and run c code on my phone. How cool.</p>
<br>

<p>A lot of consumer business comes down to do you want to trade time for money or money for time. You can buy fast food or buy it from a shop and cook it. One is quicker but more expensive, the other is slower but cheaper.  I believe that a lot of simple services like delivery, food, repair, cleaning, etc come down to this idea. Other more advances services can but are different since most people can't do advanced mechanical repairs or programming for example.</p>
<br>

<p>People who whine about coding algorithm quizes probably can't do them.</p>
<br>

<p>Peakcocks tail is when your fermented metal gives off a petrol, rainbow like color on the bubbles that come out of it.</p>
<br>

<p>If you are an intelligent person, think of yourself like a mage in a video game. Your staff does no damage, you're weak to anything physical. You need to get a good spell and use it. Your magic is your only strength.</p>
<br>

<h4>16/7/25</h4>
<br>

<p>Age 21 is the peak of energy, around 25 is when you're no longer a young adult for men, 23 for women.</p>
<br>

<p>Heat turns things into their simpler forms.</p>
<br>

<h4>17/7/25</h4>
<br>

<p>Get the largest battery you can for your vehicle. They're all 12vs but hold different amps. A volt meter set to dc voltage can check it to see how much juice you have. Also check your lights regularly enough if you haven't change globes for a while.</p>
<br>

<p>Focusing on the body puts you in the external world, focusing on the head puts you in your own mental world.</p>
<br>

<p>Regulus is the purified metal supposedly.</p>
<br>

<p>Salt is water + earth(Pure salt?). Sulfur is Air + fire(essence?). Mercury is water + air (Solvent thinned down?)</p>
<br>

<h4>18/7/25</h4>
<br>

<p>I sure do love menus. 2d, array perfection. Selectors of the digital world.</p>
<br>

<p>Unfortunately, if you're stuck in a bad position, you should always be planning, preparing, thinking and working towards the future.</p>
<br>

<p>Putting material in a vacuum then heating it with fire can sublimate certain things.</p>
<br>

<p>The jaw/throat, mercury, basic electrical signals, these are all related to "communication protocols". How communication works. Computers and machines use a binary system, 1 and 0 which can make up all words, letters, numbers, etc. Language is our human communication protocol. </p>
<br>

<p>Forget if I said this before but the zoomers all have social autism. You have to be the one to speak first, even when they're working customer service. Mostly they're not bad people, just stuck in a neurologically damaged state.</p>
<br>

<p>Wireless tech is kinda magic.</p>
<br>

<p>Sugar is love.</p>
<br>

<p>Pure things can be more easily degraded/corrupted by their environment.</p>
<br>

<p>So if capacitors are like solid state batteries, more electrostatic, then batteries are like chemical ones, would mechanical batteries be something?
Or are there inductor farms or something?</p>
<br>

<p>Good car stuff to have. Electric air pump, jump starter, power inverter, screw drivers, adjustable wrench and socket wrench kit, battery puncture kits, multi-meter</p>
<br>

<h4>19/7/25</h4>
<br>

<p>If you aren't ready to die then you can't live.</p>
<br>

<h4>20/7/25</h4>
<br>

<p>I think part of you needing to be high enough status for women might be just so it satisfies their social side so that their friends or society wont look down on her for being with you. Even if she subconsciously wants you.</p>
<br>

<p>Learn how something works(physics, language) then learn how to use it/engineer it/build it</p>
<br>

<p>I think the slow jankyness of old games actually helped make them more enjoyable. Modern games try to maximize action, speed and excitement but older games style feels better if you want to relax a bit and think things through.<p>
<br>

<p>Exercise and qigong can help you to clear the arteries, veins and nerves of stagnation. This helps to heal and restore circulation and control to the physical body.</p>
<br>

<h4>22/7/25</h4>
<br>

<p>Program it out first. Refactor/fix/optimize later. Stop caring about using a bunch of if statements. Bad code is better than no code. Just "draw" or "play". I will NOT use switch statements. I will NOT write clean code. This goes for anything. Get beyond the state of over analyzing or trying to make something that is socially safe/appealing.</p>
<br>

<p>Technology that can translate thought into computer data.</p>
<br>

<h4>23/7/25</h4>
<br>

<p>I've been studying some colonial history and it seem like African blacks are just the archetype slaves. When they say slaves it is usually referring to Africans. They were a resource like cotton or grain that was shipped into different colonies to harvest, process and manufacture.</p>
<br>

<p>Medhya rasayana - rejuvinating the intellect/spirit.</p>
<br>

<h4>24/7/25</h4>
<br>

<p>Studying history lets you understand the present. Why cities are named as they are, why certain ethnic groups and regions exist. Religions, etc. It's the prequel to current reality.</p>
<br>

<p>I really hope we get some resolution to the payment processor issue going on now. Itch and steam removing eroge, probably most other sites as well, this isn't good. Crypto is the obvious pivot but the gas/transfer fees for that are so ridiculously expensive that it isn't worth paying like 5-10$ to buy a 7-12$ game. Creating another payment processor relies on huge amounts of money and power. Going back to barter wont work well neither will legal loopholes for long.</p>
<br>

<p>Wood = Growth. Fire = Energy. Earth = Stability. Metal = Refinement. Water = Adaptability.</p>
<br>

<p>I notice that most new cars are all made to be super performance cars, 4wd, 4 brakes, turbo charged, over 2lt engines or v6. They throw it in a an SUV body so it has poor power to weight ratio and handling since its raised. My idea is that manufacturers are trying to make cars that compensate for peoples poor driving skills, give them the illusion of safetly, power and good handling with all of the automated features.</p>
<br>

<h4>25/7/25</h4>
<br>

<p>I think that the loss of "eggs" for fertility for a woman is the loss of yin energy/essence at the bottom of the torso. Men seem to have to develop this energy, and they gain worldly success as it develops while women loose their attraction as they loose it.</p>
<br>

<p>Supposedly there was a Chinese emperor who rode a goat drawn carriage around his land, where the goat stopped he fucked whatever women was there. Absolute mandate of hell/10.</p>
<br>

<p>The Chinese suffered great losses and humiliation at the hands of mostly western countries through the last couple hundred years. You can now see why they are so willing to improve and are playing to win. Humiliation is one of the strongest driving factors.</p>
<br>

<p>Everything is just an array of arrays.</p>
<br>

<p>The rulers of great kingdoms usually devolve into either screwing a harem of thousands or restoring order and stability to the kingdom. Not both unfortunately.</p>
<br>

<p>The upper sphere of society is law, politics and corporations. The upper class learn these from their youth and then go on to control and create them.</p>
<br>

<h4>26/7/25</h4>
<br>

<p>AI is being used more for customer service which is making it more difficult to talk to the heart of a company. Before, it wasn't easy with offshored labor. Now it is worse.</p>
<br>

<p>The young men give me confidence that they'll be okay but the young women don't. The same way the past young men had to self improve, I think the women will need to. Essentially the women have fallen into corruption because of the luxuries they were afforded and it has made them weaker.</p>
<br>

<p>When a mans dick retracts he is in a very positive-tensed state, when it elongates without getting hard he is in a negative-relaxed state.</p>
<br>

<p>"How do you even wipe your ass with that attitude"</p>
<br>

<h4>27/7/25</h4>
<br>

<p>The hard work you do that feels meaningless in the moment and doesn't seem to make you improve short term is building up a foundation. This part is the slowest and most difficult. Eventually when the foundation is set, you will move up to the next level and begin to see results.</p>
<br>

<p>"Data structures -</p>
<p>Level 1 (Start here) → Array, Object, Set, Map</p>
<p>Level 2 (Add pattern power) → Stack, Queue, Linked List</p>
<p>Level 3 (Handle structures) → Tree, Hash Table</p>
<p>Level 4 (Problem solving) → Graph, Heap</p>
<p>Level 5 (Rare/advanced) → Trie, Segment Tree" - Probably ChatGPT</p>
<br>

<p>J*** might actually be mercury/mercurial.</p>
<br>

<p>Looks like VR glasses and I mean a headset which is physically like a pair of glasses has currently hit the market. I think you can plug these into your phone, maybe pc and mirror the visuals. Adding a gyroscope would be good for vr compatible games. I imagine VR will split into heavy and light models.</p>
<br>

<p>Power to weight matters for vehicles. Similar to power bands and red line limits. That's how smaller engines can out perform larger ones sometimes when it comes to distance travelled per watt of power applied. Larger pistons/displacement usually means more lower end torque while higher rpm equals more top end speed.<p>
<p>Similarly tyre grip and air intake matters too. If your tyres can't handle the power or your engine can't rev enough then a big engine is wasted. Finding a balance with these is important. Similarly the more power you have, the more breaking you need to withstand it.</p>
<p>Final note is your suspension and vehicle height matter as well as size for turning. Raised vehicles with soft suspension obviously jiggle like jelly. This is why SUV's are still a joke even with 4 disks, 4wd, turbo, v6 and over 2-3lt engines.</p>
<br>

<h4>28/7/25</h4>
<br>

<p>I imagine in the future your small devices that connect wirelessly will have a "power wirelessly" option where you can charge/power them off radio towers.</p>
<br>

<p>Conquering level 1 seems to be conquering nature. So you no longer need to suffer from rain, heat, wind, etc. Hence why having a house, car, appliances, food, etc are all related to it. Then lvl 2 is the social world. Conquering that, people I imagine. Knowing how to interact with them, function in a social environment. Under that kind of pressure, etc.</p>
<br>

<h4>29/7/25</h4>
<br>

<p>Algorithmic speed-</p>
<p>O(n) = Speed constant with data. Linear increase. Looping, linked list searching.</p>
<p>O(1) = fastest you can get. Doesn't matter about data size.</p>
<p>O(log n) = Binary search. Fast.</p>
<p>O(n log n) = Slowish, quicksort, mergesort, heapsort. Slows down with larger datasets.</p>
<p>O(n^2) = Very slow, insertion sort, selection sort, bubblesort.</p>
<p>O(n!) = the slowest.</p>
<br>

<p>Telnet is pretty cool for simple server apps. You can acsess it with the net api in node.js - https://nodejs.org/api/net.html</p>
<p>Essentially TCP networking where you send over raw text. As low level as you can get.</p>
<br>

<p>Womens power is their yin. If you develop your own yin force you can defend against them.</p>
<br>

<p>The goyim do no think, they only feel or repeat.</p>
<br>

<p>The urge to build a boat and sail away off into the distance.</p>
