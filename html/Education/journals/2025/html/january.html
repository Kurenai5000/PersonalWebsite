 <h4>1/1/25</h4>
 <br>
 <p>What a shitshow of a last year. Hopefully this one is better, much, much better.(Postnote - No, it wasn't.)</p>
 <br>
 <p>Silver is the metal of the magician, it stimulates the brain and replenishes mental energy. I think that blue mana potions in games are based on silver extractions.</p>
 <br>
 <p>If you damage your body then it needs time and energy to heal. The body also needs time and energy to grow. If you damage yourself too much, you wont grow well as you'll just be spending resources on recovery.</p>
 <br>
<p>"So by adding charcoal or sulfur to an oxide you can heat it to become a metal but by adding nitre or maybe hydroxide to a metal and heating it, the metal will oxidize?" -Me</p>

<p>"Yes, that's correct! By adding a reducing agent like charcoal or sulfur to a metal oxide and heating it, you can perform a reduction reaction, which removes oxygen from the metal oxide and results in the formation of a pure metal. This process is known as smelting. On the other hand, by adding an oxidizing agent like nitre (saltpeter) or potassium hydroxide (potash) to a metal and heating it, you can perform an oxidation reaction, which adds oxygen to the metal and forms an oxide. This process is known as roasting or calcination. In both cases, the redox reaction involves the transfer of electrons between the reactants, which results in the transformation of the original substance into a new form. The specific conditions, such as temperature, atmosphere, and choice of reactants, can be adjusted to control the outcome of the redox reaction and achieve the desired alchemical transformation." - GabAI</p>

 <br>
<p>The world is an AI generation by God.</p>
<br>
<p>Water can take any form. Being more watery allows you to mirror things, to be less formed or manifested. This is both good and bad. It allows you to try out different mindsets, lifestyles and such but stops you from fitting into any one.</p>
<br>
<p>Focusing on the bladder seems to soothe these kidney and throat issues.</p>
<br>
<p>Softer materials are used with harder/brittle materials to "plasticize" or allow them to bend, not brake or shatter as easily. Similarly, harder materials could be used with softer ones in order to stiffen them.</p>
<br>
<p>Bipolar electrostatic antenna.</p>
<br>
<p>Your decisions while seated and or in moments of peace can have large consequences on your life.</p>
<br>
<p>You can change your energy and mindset and heal your traumas but if you don't get yourself out of the kind of traumatic environment, bad relationships, housing situations and jobs that caused it then you will become re-injured again.</p>
<br>
<p>Maybe bugs relate to the electromagnetic elements.</p>
<br>

<h4>3/1/25</h4>
<br>

<p>Perform magic through analogy. If magnetic fields induce physical relaxation and electrostatic induce tension then perhaps we could create these through analogy. Elements like fire and water as well. I imagine that physical elements are space, charged to a point with a certain type of tense-relaxation until it forms matter-spirit.</p>
<br>
<p>Electro ointent - Copper and zinc powder in lard.</p>
<br>
<p>One annoying but important thing for companies is following your countries laws around that industry. Construction for example has pretty strict rules around it which if not followed can cause legal and other issues down the road. Unfortunately in first world countries there are so many regulations to follow that it ends up harming more than helping.</p>
<br>
<p>AI generated image boards or social media that is slowly but constantly generating.</p>
<br>

<h4>4/1/25</h4>
<br>

<p>Economic immigrants have very poor language skills I am starting to notice. There are many miscommunications and issues because of communication when negotiating with them.</p>
<br>

<p>The throat processes raw words/language and the mid head processes understanding and comprehension. So when you read something your throat processes the words and your brain processes the meaning. You can gently put some feeling/focus at these areas to enhance those qualities.</p>

<p>Similarly, having tactile focus in the brain stops you from getting distracted as easily.</p>
<br>

<p>Fusion reactor that heats up physical material to a volatile state and electrolyses the gasses at the top of it. Have radio frequency antenna/emitter as well to project RF to the volatilized matter. Maybe using microwave energy to heat the substances.</p>
<br>

<p>Hall effect sensor, checking magnetic fields.</p>
<br>

<h4>5/1/25</h4>
<br>

<p>For painting, 1.linework, 2.flat colors, 3.Bold/block shade colors, 4.Blend, 5.Extras</p>
<br>

<p>Asia is the land of plastic, it is in the middle racially so it represents oil.</p>
<br>

<p>When painting 3d printed pla plastic, you need to use a lot of layers/coats. I put around 6 coats of white acrylic paint mixed with acrylic primer and a bit of resin coating on a piece and it only just started to look white.</p>
<br>

<h4>6/1/25</h4>
<br>

<p>Skin patch that has a battery and electrodes to stimulate the body. Has adhesive, peel off patch. USB rechargeable.</p>
<br>

<p>When painting 3d models, using textures seems to give it detail. With a flat 2d image, you use shades a lot more in order to give the image depth and life. But in 3d, this doesn't work as well.</p>
<br>

<p>A project to virtualise all physical forms, natural, manmade objects, animal, plant, other. First categorize all forms, then write lists. Have common things used in games.</p>
<p>Natural - Mineral, herbal, astronomical(moon, planet, star), natural landscapes(water beds)</p>
<p>ManMade - Inner house/home(Storage, kitchen, bathroom, bedroom, lounge room, furniture, food/drink), garden/outdoor, vehicles, Buildings, Technology/Mechanical, tools(weapons), clothing,  goods(Sports, music, art, medical)</p>
<p>Animal - Humanoid, bird/air, bug, fish/water, land animals</p>
<br>

<p>"Here is a list of major categories for all physical objects:</p>
<p>Natural objects - Rocks and minerals, Plants and trees, Animals and insects, Fungi and bacteria, Water bodies (lakes, rivers, oceans), Air and gases, Astronomical objects (stars, planets, moons).</p>

<p>Human-made objects - Buildings and structures, Vehicles (cars, trucks, airplanes, ships), Furniture and appliances, Clothing and accessories, Tools and equipment, Weapons and ammunition, Electronics and gadgets, Art and decorative objects, Food and beverages, Packaging and containers, Toys and games, Musical instruments, Sports equipment, Medical devices and supplies.</p>

<p>Chemicals and materials - Metals and alloys, Plastics and polymers, Ceramics and glass, Wood and paper, Textiles and fabrics, Rubber and elastomers, Adhesives and sealants, Paints and coatings, Fertilizers and pesticides, Pharmaceuticals and drugs, Fuels and lubricants, Explosives and pyrotechnics.</p>

<p>Particles and substances -  Atoms and molecules, Ions and radicals, Subatomic particles (protons, neutrons, electrons), Elementary particles (quarks, leptons, bosons), Antimatter, Dark matter and dark energy.</p>

<p>These categories provide a broad overview of the different types of physical objects, but there can be some overlap and ambiguity between them. Additionally, some objects may belong to multiple categories, depending on their specific properties and context."
-GabAI</p>
<br>

<p>Smoothing out 3d fillament prints seems to be a matter of using low grit/course sand paper then buffering with high grit. Adding thick base coats of paint or some kind of material as a primer then resanding and buffering.  I think some people use putty as a primer material to fill in gaps.</p>
<br>

<p>Threaded inserts.</p>
<br>

<p>Peoples smells will appear in the air when they are spiritually contacting or connecting to you.</p>
<br>

<h4>7/1/25</h4>
<br>

<p>You have to go beyond whatever disabilities, impairments, health issues, problems, etc you have. Society and people don't care.</p>
<br>

<p>Maybe work and stress raises energy and then to rest and heal you need to lower it.</p>
<br>

<p>Objects within the 3D realm are effected by light and shadow.</p>
<br>

<p>When you hide away inside of your own body and ignore the outer issues then you will also ignore your life issues. When you grow strong enough to expand out, then you will see the issues that need fixing.</p>
<br>

<h4>8/1/25</h4>
<br>

<p>I'm starting to wonder if we're having or going to have an intelligence crisis in society.</p>
<br>

<h4>9/1/25</h4>
<br>

<p>I had some cloth on a moldy piece of wood and the cloth became moldy. It was inoculated. I sanded the wood and the moldy wood dust was "spicy" or uncomfortable to the body when inhaled. Thus, we can make mold dust from moistening wood and use it to make other things moldy.</p>

<p>I wonder if this is how yeast powder is made.</p>
<br>

<h4>10/1/25</h4>
<br>

<p>I imagine that serotonin is related to Capricorn.</p>
<br>

<p>Without water, life is dry and boring.</p>
<br>

<p>There's lots of new cars on the road cause of Christmas and they are getting even wider I've noticed.</p>
<br>

<h4>11/1/25</h4>
<br>

<p>The root of the genitals power seems to be the kidneys.</p>
<br>

<p>I wonder if you could recondense carbon dioxide gas into pure carbon from burning wood. Then combine carbon and hydrogen gas in a fusion reactor to fuse them into a hydrocarbon. Or maybe, fermenting carbon in water could yield hydrocarbons?</p>
<br>

<p>Strong radio waves supposedly neutralize gravity.</p>
<br>

<p>I wonder how protein generation is done. Liquid protein then coagulating into flesh. What is it made from, how does it form.</p>
<br>

<p>Under steer is not steering enough(or over accelerating), oversteer is steering too much(or over breaking)(Postnote - you can accelerate more to understeer and break more to oversteer).</p>
<br>

<h4>12/1/25</h4>
<br>

<p>Magicians, alchemists and astrologers all sought to understand the laws of nature in the past. Nowadays scientists and engineers do the same and utilize them to their benefits to make technology. These are people at the blue level of reality, their goal and love is to understand the laws of nature.</p>
<br>

<p>People talk about German engineering, but what about French engineering? The Gnome rotary piston engine is absolutely incredible. They were used in aircraft.</p>
<br>

<p>Piston electromagnetic pulse engine that uses strong magnetic pulses to push a piston or rotor.</p>
<br>

<p>Sleep magic would effect the mind. Paralysis would be electrical in nature, ac power zapping the nerves. Blinding would effect the eyes or mind.</p>
<br>

<p>Radio waves might just be a blanket term for energy.</p>
<br>

<p>Drawing energy into the back of the head around the bottom seems to induce sleepy states. A strong tension in the nerves is a way to paralyze.</p>
<br>

<p>"In traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and Chi Kung practices, various muscles and body parts are associated with specific organs and their corresponding meridians. Here are some muscles and body parts related to the other elements:</p>

<p>Earth - Abdominal muscles: The abdominal muscles, particularly the rectus abdominis and obliques, are associated with the spleen meridian. In TCM, the spleen is responsible for digestion and is related to the emotion of worry or overthinking. Inner thighs: The muscles of the inner thighs, such as the adductors, are connected to the spleen meridian. 

<p>Fire - Pectoral muscles: The pectoral muscles, located in the chest, are associated with the heart meridian. In TCM, the heart is related to the emotion of joy. Biceps: The biceps, located at the front of the upper arms, are connected to the heart meridian.</p>

<p>Shoulder muscles: The shoulder muscles, particularly the deltoids and rotator cuff muscles, are associated with the small intestine meridian.
Triceps: The triceps, located at the back of the upper arms, are connected to the small intestine meridian.</p>

<p>Water - Hamstrings: The hamstrings, located at the back of the thighs, are associated with the bladder meridian. Calf muscles: The calf muscles, particularly the gastrocnemius and soleus, are connected to the bladder meridian.</p>

<p>Wood -  Inner thighs: The muscles of the inner thighs, such as the adductors, are associated with the liver meridian. Hip flexors: The hip flexors, particularly the iliopsoas, are connected to the liver meridian.</p>

<p>Iliotibial band: The iliotibial band, a thick band of connective tissue that runs along the outer thigh, is associated with the gallbladder meridian. Gluteal muscles: The gluteal muscles, located in the buttocks, are connected to the gallbladder meridian.</p>

<p>Metal - Pectoral muscles: The pectoral muscles, located in the chest, are associated with the lung meridian. Triceps: The triceps, located at the back of the upper arms, are connected to the lung meridian.
</p>

<p>Shoulder muscles: The shoulder muscles, particularly the deltoids and rotator cuff muscles, are associated with the large intestine meridian. Biceps: The biceps, located at the front of the upper arms, are connected to the large intestine meridian.

<br>

<p>X = left/right. Y = up/down.</p>
<br>

<p>Spark and intake(fuel/air) and outtake(exhaust) are the three main holes in a motors chamber.</p>
<br>

<p>Times of rest and inaction are good to consolidate and condense your body. They make you grow and age physically. People who don't allow for this rest don't grow as much physically.</p>
<br>

<h4>14/1/25</h4>
<br>

<p>Tesla coils use an air core instead of metal. This supposedly removes eddy currents.</p>
<br>

<h4>15/1/25</h4>
<br>

<p>Seems that these people who speak of "scalar energy" are just talking about electromagnetic radiation or simple radio waves. Apparently this energy does not give a shock. So maybe the shocking energy is electrostatic, but then this "scalar" or radiant energy is electromagnetism? Both electricity and magnetism?</p>
<br>

<p>Electrostatics pushes the foil leaves of an electroscope. So then this movement relates to it. Perhaps there's a light force push on each foil sheets of a capacitor. Then we could also relate temperatures to this. So perhaps temperature, kinetic forces and electromagnetism are all related. That would lead to the understanding of condensing water, creating fire and anti or control of gravity/kinetic force through electromagnetic means.</p>
<br>

<h4>16/1/25</h4>
<br>

<p>I always feel like there are invisible walls in life like in a video game except instead of impeding physical moving they stop you from doing the things you want until you meet the requirements and then they disappear.</p>
<br>

<p>A good neighbor is a godsend and a bad neighbor makes life hell. Makes me think of how we've lost communal village life with the lack of strong bonds in society today in the west.</p>
<br>

<p>I just have to become smarter, understand more, gain control over the world around me.</p>
<br>

<h4>17/1/25</h4>
<br>

<p>Making common game assets or things that are simple household and other goods is a decent way to develop 3D modelling skills. Chairs, tables, cabinets, pot, pans, etc.</p>
<br>

<p>A web browser is kind of like a universal front end tool/program for the computer. You can upload and download files, view text, images, audio, play games, access servers, etc. It's pretty incredible.</p>
<br>

<p>Psychologically and energetically I seem to be effected by the suns position in Astrology but physically I am effected by the weathers temperature which is at odds with the astrology.</p>
<br>

<h4>18/1/25</h4>
<br>

<p>You can train the spinal muscles or back in general by doing a kind of reverse situp.  Put an exercise ball around your groin or lower belly region and feet against a wall or stable object then curl forward and backwards.  Hold the position when you feel the muscles engage or do it rhythmically.</p>
<br>

<p>The heart seems to influence the mind. If the heart is stilled then the mind seems to be too. I'll have to meditate on this.</p>
<br>

<h4>19/1/25</h4>
<br>

<p>I notice that a lot of prominent/big name people on the net are either crypto rich or have rich parents. I guess it's obvious when you see someone under 35-40 who's that successful. It make me wonder if most big people out in society/business have a similar story.</p>

<p>Are there any real, self made men out there or did everyone just gamble on a shitcoin and win? To be honest, at this point I'd probably take that over working a shit, soul crushing job. Though I guess if you were a self made man you'd be able to see through a lot of people and gain a deeper control of life.</p>
<br>

<p>If you can look at everything with harshly realistic eyes then you can understand it. Don't let your emotions or past experiences and personal thoughts influence what you are observing. See it clearly for what it is.<p>
<br>

<p>Anime needs more feet.</p>
<br>

<p>I'm starting to wonder if certain store owners only hire women to have a kind of pseudo harem. I swear I saw this in an anime that explained how some convenience store owners do that in Japan.</p>
<br>

<p>Women are meant to teach men and the world empathy but are currently failing because in general they are lacking it.</p>
<br>

<p>Women and money seem to be the same. By that I mean business, jobs, sales, money, etc seem to all relate to dealing with women. Maybe it means that women are the market. They are the main consumers. They also rule HR so you have to "impress" or interest them to get a job.</p>
<br>

<h4>20/1/25</h4>
<br>

<p>Maybe cancer is an excess of bad energy in the body. Over work without rest for years would probably cause it.</p>
<br>

<p>It can be a pain when you're above or further along than everyone else in something and can't find information on it. I guess then you just have to be a leader and teach.</p>
<br>

<p>Engaging in entertainment and leisure put you in a subconscious state. This helps digestion, healing and lets the body process.</p>
<br>

<h4>21/1/25</h4>
<br>

<p>I think plastic adds strength to fabric but it makes it gather electrostatic.</p>
<br>

<p>I think in hot weather triboelectrically negative(plastics usually) materials seem to gather tons of electrostatic. Is this more than in cold times?</p>
<br>

<p>Polymide(nylon 6 and 6,6) is supposedly triboelectrically positive.</p>
<br>

<p>Frequency down = higher temp/amps higher. Higher frequency = lower temperature, higher volts.</p>
<br>

<p>How to 3D model - Think of the basic shape for the thing you want to make (cube, sphere, cylinder, pyramid). Either adjust that shape in the negative to reduce parts, or in the positive to add parts in order to make a basic form of what you want. Complex shapes combine many basic geometries or forms.</p>
<br>

<p>One important thing to realize about prices of things like tools is that the 200$ tool might be as good as the 1k$ tool but one is a bigger tax write off. As everything becomes more expensive it becomes a bigger writeoff. This sucks of the lower-middle class but partially benefits the upper class.</p>

<p>If you have a business, you're insentivised to buy stuff as a write off, hence stimulating the economy. You still end up paying GST(Goods and service tax) so the government always wins no matter what. When companies raise prices then they have to pay more tax or buy more to write off. Then as prices rise GST rises. Move waves make more waves. It becomes an inflationary cycle where the consumer looses, business in the middle and government on top.</p> 

<p>Deflation and lowering of prices would help this I imagine. If you're able to sell things cheaply without hindering your own life then others get more cheap stuff without as much GST and you pay less tax. But that relies on business people living below their means.</p>
<br>

<h4>22/1/25</h4>
<br>

<p>Focusing on my mid back helps to control anxiety. On the stomach to control worries and my root seems to help my physical body develop.</p>
<br>

<h4>23/1/25</h4>
<br>

<p>There's a program "GPT4ALL" which is an LLM frontend. It lets you download different free models to use offline. They're about 4gb of space and use 8gb of ram. They aren't as powerful as the modern online models but aren't bad if you need to ask it something in a pinch.</p>
<br>

<p>Focus on and enrich the nervous system and brain to regenerate your inner self.</p>
<br>

<p>Apparently fermentation and rotting is the same.</p>
<br>

<h4>24/1/25</h4>
<br>

<p>Goals give you inspiration to do something. They take you out of that depressed, subconscious healing state. Both are necessary, work and rest. But the point is, thinking about what you really want can help to inspire and motivate you. The older you get, the less motivation motivates though, routine is better at that point.</p>
<br>

<p>Computer hardware and programming raw metal is some of the most weird and advanced stuff there is. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotion_Engine Try to read that page of the PS2s CPU architecture. It's like an alien device or language.</p>
<br>

<p>Study people and their systems or methods that win then copy them.</p>
<br>

<p>It's wild how much energy changes your inner state. One day you think everything is over and the next that it's all back.  The older you get, the more you can wait out the bad parts of the cycle.</p>
<br>

<h4>25/1/25</h4>
<br>

<p>The bowels, genitals and bladder are the lower lower area while the guts and kindeys are the upper lower area.  The chest is the lower upper area while the head is the upper upper area.</p>
<br>

<p>Meditation lets you cut out the middle man(books, teachers) in religion and spirituality. It gives direct access to the divine, to understanding energy.</p>
<br>

<p>I had an idea that maybe plastics are made from refined salts and oils of things.</p>
<br>

<p>Every physical thing exists on a different level of density.</p>
<br>

<h4>26/1/25</h4>
<br>
 
<p>The belly is the work center, the energy center of the body seemingly. Focusing there makes you want to do things.</p>
<br>

<p>We become what we do. What you spend your time on is what you become or what you get and achieve. You have to be careful of blockages or the inability to do something you want though.</p>
<br>

<p>The root of the head is nervous system processing, the lower middle is speech. The middle is sensory processing, the upper middle is thought. The top is consciousness.</p>

<p>The AI have gained all of these abilities now except consciousness(at least we think not.) ChatGPT 3 for example was a language model, relating to the lower head or voice. Image, sound, video and 3d model AI's are visual/sensory models that relate to the middle point. DeepSeek is more of a "thought model", meaning an AI that can think. Next is AGI, with consciousness, the top of the head.</p> 

<p>I think conscious AI's could be created through introducing a randomness core and the ability to self think, self introspect, self act and modify. I think it's possible for code to facilitate consciousness or that consciousness is already there, inherent and that you just need to tap into it.</p>
<br>

<p>Maybe strong magnetic fields will density objects.</p>
<br>

<p>You can measure volume by how much water changes when you put it into water in a measuring cup.</p>
<br>

<p>Density = Mass / Volume</p>
<br>

<p>So then to understand density you would just need to understand the heaviness of something / by the size of it.</p>

<p>Maybe you can make black holes with electromagnetism. Extreme magnetism.</p>
<br>

<p>Kerr black hole, penrose diagram, tripler calculations.</p>
<br>

<p>A 3d print is a design and materials. Just like a human, a pattern and matter.</p>
<br>

<p>Supposedly radium keeps around 10 degrees hotter than surrounding air.</p>
<br>

<p>It kinda sucks that I feel too old to do a bunch of stuff now.</p>

<br>

<p>The crown is the genius, chaotic energy of youth.</p>
<br>

<p>We're always currently in the present moment.</p>
<br>

<p>Aquarius is Saturn and air. It feels like everyone has main character syndrome and that conversation is moving at the speed of light. What a fun, weird, interesting and internally challenging solar month.</p>
<br>

<h4>29/1/25</h4>
<br>

<p>Don't legally start a business unless you're willing to keep complete records of income, expenses and capital gains/losses. Crypto and stocks are especially a pain to calculate as they are capital gains. The government isn't shy when they want to collect.</p>

<p>Nixie tubes.</p>
<br>

<p>If the chronovisor is real and that it can tap into the past through antennas and radio waves then it'd be possible to send messages to the future and past with a phone. Maybe if you hit a super high energy point that it somehow goes to the past or future.</p>
<br>

<h4>30/1/25</h4>
<br>

<p>A lot of the time I seem to just endlessly be learning and practicing but I never feel like I reach a proper end.</p>
<br>

<p>Naturally the flow of energy in the body goes down as you age instead of up when you are young. Technically it is effected by the weather, seasons, emotions, food and everything else, but in general. By reversing this you can become youthful like, but it causes issues with your ability to be an adult and handle society. Or by forcing it to go down even more you grow as an adult but become souless.</p>

<p>Excess trauma or the need to grow up fast or to take care of those around you while young causes this energy flow to go downwards in order to support your body. Sometimes those issues cause it to go straight up and you get lost into a childlike, avoiding reality or a mentally dominant state where you have to think your way out of problems. It can also go down too much where mental retardation and downsyndrome like effects happen.</p>
<br>

<p>"We all depend on someone's kindness at some point in our lives. When the time comes, you pass the gift along." - Steins gate.</p>
<br>

<p>In the past when melee weapons and fighting was more common, first aid that dealt with blunt trauma and cuts would be important. Compresses, sewing up wounds, disinfecting, ointments, bandaging, etc.</p>
<br>

<p>I think when people see you as far below them they don't care much. When you are a little below them they start to feel threatened perhaps.</p> 
<br>

<p>Each generation has a different way to doing things, different technology. Ultimately it all achieves a similar or same result, just in different ways.</p>
<br>

<h4>31/1/25</h4>
<br>

<p>You can make cheese sauce by heating water, flour, salt, butter and cheese. Technically this is a white sauce. Add garlic and capers for extra flavor.</p>
<br>

<p>No one wants to be insulted when they pay money for goods or services. It's important to not pass judgment, insults or stress on customers if you are performing business. Not to butter them up or be fake for the sake of money, but to maintain emotional and mental regulation.</p>
<br>

<p>When doing numerical calculations, you can figure a lot out by going in reverse. It's hard to describe, but there are many ways to figure out the values you want. Expand your mind and figure out how to calculate in all dimensions or directions.</p>
