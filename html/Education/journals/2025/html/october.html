 <h4>1/10/24</h4>
<br>

<p>Imagine this. An oven that has a fan and heating element to heat the air combined with a microwave magnetron that heats the food. Heat up and crisp food in minutes.</p>
<br>

<p>"Dew is the essence of water."</p>
<br>

<p>You can think of everything as a question of "Do I want to exchange the time, effort and money to get/achieve it?".</p>
<br>

<p>What if ADHD childrens parents abused stimulants.</p>
<br>

<p>Alchemy is just replicating nature in a lab. Then you can go beyond nature and into the super natural.</p>
<br>

<h4>2/10/25</h4>
<br>

<p>Learn difference between revenue and profit.(Postnote - Revenue is total income earned. Profit is after tax, wages and expenses.)</p>
<br>

<h4>3/10/25</h4>
<br>

<p>It's possible we could make jewellery that is magical in nature. Either emitting of a certain radiation from the configuration of the matter or from electromagnetic means that could influence the human body, remove ageing, etc.</p>
<br>

<p>Sora2 is nuts. Video AI is probably going to be everywhere soon. I bet companies will use it for adds.</p>
<br>

<h4>4/10/25</h4>
<br>

<p>I think when the genitals are cut off from the body circulation and nervous system wise that the person exhibits sociopathic tendencies. Perhaps excess use of the genitals could also trigger a similar situation.</p>
<br>

<p>I had a thought that survival will become the new "god" the same way the money was. Money is becoming only a means to survival.</p>
<br>

<p>I'm currently porting software to android and IOS and apparently you gotta run proprietary apple software to compile and you can only do it on a mac computer. Why do people even bother porting to IOS.. Pain in the ass. I hear you can use subscription services to rent an apple computer. Otherwise I hear they update things so often that I dunno if a used computer would work. I guess we're just on android and pc for now.</p>
<br>

<h4>5/10/25</h4>
<br>

<p>Saturn is the master or ruler planet in Astrology. Life or reality follows Saturn.</p>
<br>

<p>Some people just have it and others don't. It's like not all vegetables are potatoes. We all love potatoes. Not everyone is a potato but like another vegetable.</p>
<br>

<h4>6/10/25</h4>
<br>

<p>Servers seemingly are ways to remotely control files and text. So it's like remotely controlling a computer like via the bash terminal, making files, deleting them, editing them, copying, moving, etc.</p>
<br>

<p>In the Chinese language voltage is "电压" Dianya or electrical pressure. We use the word "voltage" which is comes from the unit Volt which is named after Alessandro Volta.</p>
<p>Point being, I've thought that one reason the Chinese are beating us intellectually is that their words actually describe the thing while ours don't as often.</p>
<p>Another example is with atom or "原子" yuanZi. The first character is original, primary, raw, I think it is also used as source, and zi the second character can be egg, seed, child but in this case means "small thing".</p>
<p>So it means the original small thing. Way better than just the word "atom".</p>
<br>

<h4>7/10/25</h4>
<br>

<p>If you don't understand something then submerge yourself into it until you do. Keep focus even when you're confused. Keep trying and going and little by little it will unravel.</p>
<br>

<p>So from what I can understand, the basis of backend is just setting up middleware(GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for different routes(virtual addresses like / for root, /shop for shop, /shop/shirts for shirts). Then there's stuff like timing, async, file management, error handling and security thrown on top of it.</p>
<br>

<p>What do I even want to do with my life or in life? I spend all my energy and time learning and pushing my life forward but haven't stopped and thought about what I actually want to do for myself.</p>
<br>

<h4>8/10/25</h4>
<br>

<p>Rest in peace to Robert Murray-Smith, a great engineer.</p>
<br>

<p>Don't wait on a future that could never come. Build it yourself.</p>
<br>

<p>Sales is the positive/active aspect and marketing is the negative or passive.</p>
<br>

<h4>9/10/25</h4>
<br>

<p>Most people seem to like stories of super heroes, exceptional individuals but don't think to become one themselves.</p>
<br>

<p>Fibers are supposedly crystalline protein structures.</p>
<br>

<p>Super apps are the next level of apps. Usually these could start as a chat app/social media.</p>
<br>

<p>node.js lets you run js in the terminal/locally.</p>
<br>

<p>The hatred of working a common job fuels the desire to make a personal business.</p>
<br>

<p>Plastic-metal-ceramic hybrid filament that use volatile plastics which burn off during the print process partially. Maybe that could be used to 3d print new engines.</p>
<br>

<p>Microwave sintering.</p>
<br>

<p>Supposedly the dense ionization caused from alpha radiation like by polonium can dissipate static charge.</p>
<br>

<p>Some things happen just to push you forward, to expand your world. Don't fixate on what isn't meant to stay or be. Be happy that it happened to teach you so much.</p>
<br>

<h4>10/10/25</h4>
<br>

<p>Intelligence can be a life accelerator.</p>
<br>

<h4>11/10/25</h4>
<br>

<p>I think in the next 5-10 years that the west will come to understand its faults. It will understand its lack of a root, a base, stability.</p>
<br>

<p>Apparently capacitors block dc and pass ac while inductors pass dc and block ac. Capacitors resistor voltage change, inductors resist current change.</p>
<br>

<h4>13/10/25</h4>
<br>

<p>PETG is next level compared to PLA or PLA+ in terms of hardness, waterproofness and heatproofness I'm finding for 3d printing. Definitely recommend. Not for test projects though. Test and design in PLA.</p>
<p>PETG seems more brittle than PLA. But thick PETG is very strong. Seemingly stronger than PLA which can peel off due to bad layer line adhesion.</p>
<br>

<p>Gold is said to be the perfect form of metal, a refinement of it or the essence of metal.</p>
<br>

<p>"Living organic plastic".</p>
<br>

<p>-Human physical composition - Protein - 50-60%, Minerals - 30-35%, Fats - 5-10%, Carbohydrates - 1-2%.</p>
<br>

<p>Vacuum plasma coagulation. Coagulating plastics or other materials from plastic into certain shapes using harmonics and frequency and then condensing them into a object.</p>
<br>

<h4>14/10/25</h4>
<br>

<p>Within danger is potential.</p>
<br>

<h4>15/10/25</h4>
<br>

<p>Dynamic web coding with event delegation is nuts. You're no longer just solving problems of logic and data that is seen and known but now working in further darkness, having to imagine invisible things that make more invisible things.</p> 
<br>

<h4>16/10/25</h4>
<br>

<p>I'm starting to understand that games are split into three main things - 1.Initializing the game data, 2.Updating graphics, 3.Functions/loops and I/O or input/event loops/functions. That way you don't delete your input events when recalling the graphics. The input events change the graphical data which is then updated via the updateGraphics function that uses graphics data.</p> 
<br>

<h4>17/10/25</h4>
<br>

<p>The social realm is above the guts and below the head, in the chest region because the major organs there dictate control major emotions.</p> 
<p>Brain/head is space and stars. Chest region organs is the common world of man. Heart is the sun in the sky(lungs), liver is the greenery, grass and trees upon the land/dirt/earth(stomach). Kidneys are the lakes and waterbeds. The belly and pelvic region is the underground. Bowels are the bedrock and bladder/generative centers are the underground lakes and oil reservoirs. Guts are the minerals and earthly matters.</p> 
<br>

<p>War is on the horizon and most western countries aren't prepared at all for it. I thought about how I can save my country but the people in it are mostly assholes. I'm torn between two sides. These people don't deserve my help.</p> 
<br>

<p>Learning to initiate and be quick about things is important. Most people are passive and slow. Or fast and initiate in the wrong areas.</p> 
<br>

<h4>19/10/25</h4>
<br>

<p>Learning the birthchart is learning the root or origin of that person. Then learning the future astrology is to know the cycles and experiences you will go through. This can be heavy knowledge to accept as you may have a rough fate.</p> 
<br>

<p>Maybe fermenting is how you multiply metals?</p> 
<br>

<h4>20/10/25</h4>
<br>

<p>6 Levels of algorithmic complexity</p> 
<p>1 - Basic data manipulation(Maths, changing types)</p> 
<p>2 - Use of loops(Modifying data in an array)</p> 
<p>3 - Nested loops(Modifying matrix)</p> 
<p>4 - Recursion(infinite cycles)</p> 
<p>5 - Adaptive algorithms(MachineLearning)</p> 
<p>6 - Algorithms that modify/create algo(AI)</p> 
<br>

<p>Terrence Mckenna's idea of reality complexify over time is interesting; novelty.</p> 
<br>

<h4>21/10/25</h4>
<br>

<p>I assume a flux is used in melting metals to "liquify" the materials because the flux melts earlier and turns to a kind of sludge which contains the metal and lets it all heat more evenly.</p> 
<br>

<p>Stop sharing energy with others who don't deserve it.</p> 
<br>

<h4>22/10/25</h4>
<br>

<p>Is an age feminine when things are very societal and built up or masculine? I'm starting to think it's more feminine. Perhaps the wild west, ages of exploration was more masculine?</p> 
<br>

<h4>23/10/25</h4>
<br>

<p>There's probably an internal body trigger to get the electrostatic or magnetism power to generate from the body to project out. Breathing into and tensing the lower abdominal is the traditional way from what I've read.</p>
<br>

<p>The thalamus is the sensory process relay hub for most senses but smell which is processed in the olfactory cortex.</p>
<br>

<h4>24/10/25</h4>
<br>

<p>Art nouveau is very floral, flowing and curvy. Art deco is more mineral like, geometrical.</p>
<br>

<p>Some tips I learned for making electronic devices. Heatshrink or wrap all connections to avoid shorts. Have long enough wires to connect but cut them short enough to not have excess wire. Use small enough wires that can easily handle amperage. Calculate and test amperage use of components.</p>
<br>

<p>Maybe non fiction is more interesting to men because it gives us information on reality. Women have more yin or lower energy and matter which acts as fuel to generate imaginations. Perhaps this is why women can read more than men.</p>
<br>

<h4>26/10/25</h4>
<br>

<p>I looked at my 3d print which is fairly strong due to the plastic and thought "I could make any small object, I can manifest anything more or less from my imagination out into a shape". I think that's pretty cool.</p>
<br>

<p>No matter what your problems are. You still have to live, pay your bills and find a way to succeed.</p>
<br>

<h4>27/10/25</h4>
<br>

<p>If you look at things relating to women and men as a "high status, low status or just not enough status" thing then you can understand interactions better. If a man doesn't have enough status, which is a level to determine value in reality for his age then the womans subconscious is guarded and protects her against that man.</p>
<br>

<p>Maybe aliens probe men in order to get their "dna".</p>
<br>

<p>Everything you do costs you energy. Every thought, word, action, etc. Focus your energy on doing what you want, not what subconscious impulses are possessing you.</p>
<br>

<h4>31/10/25</h4>
<br>

<p>Wire size for small scale dc electronics - 20awg 3-5A motors. 24awg 1.5-2A general. 28awg 0.5-0.8A signal</p>
<br>

<p>I wonder how much percent of the time people watch internet videos for social connection. Hence why ego and personality wins in that realm.
<br>

<p>Notes for music. It's hard to get more sounds in if you use really intense, heavy synths. Though you can get away with maybe 2-3 instruments in that case.</p>
<br>

<p>Maybe add 1 watt solar panels to stuff to make it chargeable.</p>
