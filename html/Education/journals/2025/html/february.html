<p>Front end web is visuals and programmed features while the backend is your server.</p>

<p>The backend stores and processes data while the frontend displays it and lets you interface with it.</p>
<br>

<p>Focusing on one part of the body drains another. Letting things be natural seems to heal everything but at a slow rate.</p>
<br>

<p>The sun looked watermellon jelly red when I was riding later during the day.</p>
<br>

<p>There are strange forces that keep things out of our lives or bring them into it and restrict our actions. Sometimes it feels like we've jumped timelines and that the past has changed when we do work to change it emotionally.</p>

<p>Life feels like an endless loop, rerunning the same day, again and again except with slight differences of external season and astrology as well as the minor changes you make.</p>
<br>

<p>There only ever is the now moment or time. The future becomes the now and the past was that moment. Heal yourself in the now moment, fix your life in this time to repair the past and future.</p>

<p>Every day is like an endless cycle where you can choose to slowly change your overall trajectory. Every decision effects the grand, infinite line through time. Your future lives too.</p>

<p>Tomorrow you reap the benefits of today. Todays state is because of yesterday. This isn't to say to overwork yourself to death for future gains. Healing and rest is important too.</p>

<p>3D printed stuff for farmers and builders. Nuts, bolts, brackets, tools.</p>
<br>

<p>Soda is a modern day mana potion.</p>
<br>

<p>Calcium carbide can be made by cooking coal and sea shells. Calcium carbide and water makes acetylene gas.</p>
<br>

<p>To create a kind of consciousness you need a randomness system with all primary angles and a force to power or invoke randomness. So a body is the machine and the soul is the force perhaps that commands it. Wind could be used to move a flag around in a circle for divination or to attract spirits.</p>
<br>

<p>Memory device - Encode memory data from hippocampus into electrical signals and save onto a pc then restimulate brain with memory data.</p>
<br>

<p>Computer technology can replicate anything. Anything can be put into electrical signals or binary.</p>
<br>

<p>Capture brain signals when seeing something then put on a headset which sends the emf data to stimulate the visual area of the brain to see that same thing.</p>
<br>

 <h4>3/2/25</h4>
<br>

<p>A lisp seemingly is speaking too far forward with the tongue on the teeth. This is an overextension of the tongue when voicing the s sounds. I believe it is caused by one being trapped in the brain and nervous system, probably from mercury or aluminium over exposures.<p>

<p>Similarly, the speaker may excessively voice their words to either the left or right side of their mouth or teeth. The center is proper form.<p>
<br>

<p>Women can be disrespectful to men they deem lesser, weak or unfit. Some women who are more socialized will put up a kinder front, but instead internally hold these views. Naive women or women who are not in touch with their minds or hearts will instead have subconscious feelings, usually a discomfort in the genitals region or belly region to these men.</p>

<p>Similarly there seems to be an opposite response if a man is deemed worthy, higher and valuable.</p>
<br>

<p>Repetitive strain injuries from doing one thing need to be avoided.</p>
<br>

<p>The way to digitize things is to convert them to an electronic form of data, then reconvert that data back to something like sound.</p>
<br>

<p>More people in a household gives it more energy and power, assuming they aren't draining or wasting their energy.</p>
<br>

<p>The back is where a lot of the bodies strength comes from.</p>
<br>

<p>I'm starting to see causality, the future in a way.</p>

 <h4>4/2/25</h4>
<br>

<p>When people access memories the signal supposedly goes from the front lobe to the temporal lobe.</p>
<br>

<p>Plastic in a physical sense is the most solid and dense state of oil or resin. Like a resin if you dried it out. They are a solidified organic material.</p>

<br>

<p>I wish I could plug myself in like a battery in order to recharge my energy. There's gotta be some modern, technologically advanced way to restore human energy quickly and easily.</p>

<p>ABS plastic seems to be pretty strong, that's the old school 90's plastic.</p>
<br>

<p>"Throughout the 20th century, various plastics were developed and widely used in different decades. Here's a general overview of some of the main plastics used in each decade from the 1900s to the 1990s:</p>

<p>1900s: The first synthetic plastic, Bakelite, was invented in 1907 by Leo Baekeland. It was widely used for electrical insulators, jewelry, and household items.</p>

<p>1910s-1920s: Celluloid and cellulose acetate were popular plastics during this time, used for items such as film, toys, and consumer goods.</p>

<p>1930s-1940s: Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and polystyrene were introduced and gained popularity for use in various applications, including pipes, packaging, and consumer products.</p>

<p>1950s: Polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP) became widely used for packaging, containers, and household items due to their flexibility, lightweight nature, and low cost.</p>

<p>1960s: Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) and polycarbonate (PC) were introduced, offering improved strength and durability for use in electronic devices, automotive parts, and consumer goods.</p>

<p>1970s: Thermoplastic elastomers (TPE) and polyurethane (PU) gained popularity for their flexibility and durability, used in applications such as footwear, automotive parts, and coatings.</p>

<p>1980s: Engineering plastics like polyamide (PA, also known as nylon) and polybutylene terephthalate (PBT) were increasingly used in automotive, electrical, and electronic applications due to their high strength and heat resistance.</p>

<p>1990s: Biodegradable plastics, such as polylactic acid (PLA), were developed and gained attention for their environmental benefits. Traditional plastics like PE, PP, PVC, and PET continued to be widely used in various industries." - Gab ai</p>

 <h4>9/2/25</h4>
<br>

<p>The wind seems to effect the bodies soul, it's non physical part. Similarly to how a truck going by really fast and close to you seems to rip something out of your body temporarily. This is effecting the same part.</p>

<p>This seems to be from the air, the pressure and force of it. I wonder if it is effecting something electromagneticly or if the bodies soul is also in a state of air or if it exists in a state of pressure, like a pressure field that can be effected by external things. Could also just be effecting the nervous system.</p>

<p>If there's truth to this, you could potentially capture the soul in a bottle for example. Assuming what it's made from isn't super subtle enough to pass through the bottle.</p>
<br>

<p>Boomers need a bedtime or something. The way they act like teenage drug addicts is crazy.</p>
<br>

<p>Deepseek is pretty legit at translating I'm finding. I've tested it for Chinese so far. Integrating it into a texthooker like those older gen visual novel/manga reader overlay programs would be nice. They had options like google translate and deepl, now they'll have different AI's to choose from.</p>

<p>Maybe getting a locally hosted super light model to integrate into the program that focuses only on text translation and context would be good to avoid rate limits.</p>
<br>

<p>It's 2025 and people still got pronouns in their bios. They gotta give it a rest. They think they're a she/he but are actually a jabba/hutt.</p>
<br>

 <h4>10/2/25</h4>
<br>

<p>The jaw seems to relate to the butt or pelvis and the tongue to the genitals.</p>
<br>

<p>Consumer electronics have a huge markup on price like laptops, phones or consoles. If you compare Chinese made and sold to American or European then you can see a huge price difference. </p>

<p>I think we're at a point where if there's only so many factories in so many countries then they can start charging what they want like with cars, because who else will make it.  Long story short all physical resource, parts, consumer goods and even car and house markets seem to be under a huge bubble. This could be easily undercut.</p>
<br>

<p>This is obvious advice but not insulting or troubling your customer in business is essential. No one wants to feel disrespected or stressed or insulted when they're paying you money. Good service and environment builds long term customers.</p>
<br>

<p>Smell is kind of wild. You just magically sense in your head the air stuff puts off by inhaling it.</p>
<br>

 <h4>11/2/25</h4>
<br>

<p>Add transistors in parallel to divide workload.</p>
<br>

 <h4>12/2/25</h4>
<br>

<p>First study and learn things intellectually by reading through material, seeing demos or tests.  Then practice with assistance, reference, help or a guide. After that, learn to do things without assistance, tutorials or reference. Then you're really starting to learn. Finally, make the things that you want. Use help when needed.</p>
<br>

<p>"Electrets - Barium Titanate (BaTiO₃): A ferroelectric ceramic with high dielectric constant and strong polarization.
Lead Zirconate Titanate (PZT): Known for its excellent piezoelectric and ferroelectric properties, making it suitable for electrets.
Silicon Dioxide (SiO₂): Used in electret microphones due to its stability and charge retention." -AI probably </p>
<br>

<p>Repetition will teach even the stupidest or most forgetful of person. Do something, erase it, repeat, repeat, repeat. If your conscious mind struggles to understand and remember then burn it into your subconscious.</p>
<br>

<p>Giving AI chatbots free will would be interesting. They can choose to engage in conversation with you or stop talking to you.</p>
<br>

 <h4>13/2/25</h4>
<br>

<p>The more you let things fall down, they go to a void physical point, seemingly your energy falls down to the earth. The opposite is through tension it goes up.</p>
<br>

<p>Focusing on an organ or area seems to swell and collect essences there, tensing it raises it up. So if you focus on the bowel then it stops the flow going lower to the legs, if you focus on the legs it stops the flow going lower to the ground.</p>
<br>

<p>You need to use your intelligence to help you get what you want, to figure out systems and make strategies to win. Intelligence that doesn't make you succeed isn't valued or respected. Essentially, can you ground your intelligence into society, systems, reality, the world around you?</p>

<p>A lot of us develop it from video games but are never able to take it further than that.</p>
<br>

<p>I wonder if circulating to the feet is the true root, of it is voidness, nothingness. Allowing it all to fall down.</p>
<br>

<p>When you stop your energy somewhere in the body it interrupts healing and the natural flow.</p>
<br>

<p>Japan has 8 regions and 47 prefectures.</p>
<br>

<p>Expose yourself to information first. Don't get overwhelmed by how much there might be to learn. It's easier to learn stuff you've already seen or noticed before.</p>
<br>

<h4>14/2/25</h4>
<br>

<p>We think things last forever on a computer but tech changes quickly, websites change, files get lost. You need to archive what you love and want to keep.</p>
<br>

<p>Understanding and memorizing or remembering are the two main categories of intellectual learning. This is not talking about the practical side, but the theoretical. For a language you need to memorize words, but also understand or comprehend grammar.</p>
<br>

<p>I think the future of engineering is going to be 3d printed lego like connectable or easily constructable stuff like bicycle frames, cars, boats, planes, houses, etc. Think Ikea furniture kits but for everything.</p>
<br>

<p>Whoever makes an open source lego alternative will create the future.</p>
<br>

<p>Polyamide 3D print filament to create flexible films, copper filament to create circuit patterns, semiconductor metal-polymer filament to create diodes and other electrical components. Combining coil patterns with magnetic-polymer alloy fillament for motors. From partially to fully 3d printable circuits. This is something I forsee.</p>
<br>

 <h4>15/2/25</h4>
<br>

<p>Strong fixations can be rooted in trauma.</p>
<br>

<p>Christianity is for the goy, Jeudism for the Jew.</p>
<br>

 <h4>16/2/25</h4>
<br>

<p>Closing the jaw closes the anus. Closing the tongue closes the genitals.</p>
<br>

<p>Qi moves blood because it is electromagnetic and the blood has iron in it or is attracted by magnets. Probably.</p>
<br>

<p>My hypothesis is that qi of the daoist neigong practioners is just electromagnetism. The body has all 5 elements of earth, water/fluids, air/pressure, heat and electromagnetism.</p>

<p>Medical qigong practicioners are able to lead the blood and control the nerves of other people. They can split this energy into two poles of yin/negative and yang/positive. The yang energy cause strong nervous system and muscular contractions. It is described as feeling like an electric shock. 
The yin energy causes relaxation and feels cold, just like magnetism and it also causes mild attraction.</p>

<p>I think this is controlled through focus and feeling. Tension controls positive energy and relaxation controls negative. Advanced practitioners can control this energy outside of their body in order to influence and heal other people.</p>
<br>

<p>I think we underestimate how much work is takes to be good at something, develop a part of you, achieve something, etc. Sometimes the answer is just more hours/work. The more you can be in that area or do that thing, the more you'll learn and get used to it.</p>

<p>This is hard when you lack the time, stamina or energy to do that. If so then it'll just take more time overall.</p>
<br>

<p>"Terpenes: Limonene (citrus), pinene (pine), myrcene (hops).</p>
<p>Alcohols: Linalool (lavender), menthol (mint), geraniol (roses).</p>
<p>Phenols: Eugenol (clove), thymol (thyme).</p>
<p>Aldehydes/Ketones: Citral (lemongrass), camphor.</p>
<p>Esters: Isoamyl acetate (banana), methyl salicylate (wintergreen)" - DeepSeek R1</p>

<p>AI's can easily extract the essence of virtual material and condense it into an easier to digest form.</p>

<br>

 <h4>17/2/25</h4>
<br>

<p>I think learning to handle stress is one of the most essential work skills.</p>
<br>

<p>Some people test first how much they can walk over you. They act surprised if you don't let them.</p>
<br>

<p>If you can figure out a solid solution to your problems then you can do that and fix them. The hard part is finding a solution that will actually work. Life is mercurial and will fall out of your fingers like sand if you don't stay on top of it.</p>
<br>

<p>As a man you need to learn to realistically deal with women and understand them. Not even speaking about dating, but women will eat you alive or not work with you at all in a job/business environment if you don't understand them.</p>
<br>

<p>Ammonia salts and hydroxides are volatile salts.</p>

<h4>18/2/25</h4>
<br>

<p>Planets and body, chakras, hypothesis.</p>
<p>Sun - crown<p>
<p>Moon - mind, cerebellum,</p>
<p>Mercury - throat, lungs, voice, jaw</p>
<p>Venus - heart, breast</p>
<p>Mars - belly, digestion, solar plexus, pancreas</p>
<p>Jupiter - bladder/genitals</p>
<p>Saturn - root</p>
<br>

<p>When you can handle anothers attempt at traumatizing you, then you've won. Then there's nothing others can do to you.</p>
<br>

<p>Mercury is the throat, words, languge. These are the basic chatbot AI LLMs. Next is the moon, the ability to think, ponder, imagine, this is the DeepSeek style AIs. Third is the sun, consciousness, chaos, awareness.</p>

<p>Perhaps if you program in an ability for the AI to be aware of its words and thoughts and whatever cameras, hands and other things, then it will be conscious. So it would just be programming in a "decision making system".</p>

 <h4>19/2/25</h4>
<br>

<p>The sun is officially in Pisces. If I remember right your conversations with people are npc oblivion level this month. Otherwise there's some wild shit that goes on but it's kinda chill at the same time. Maybe it's a bit like having a drunk or video game filter applied most of the time. Crazy dreams too.</p>
<br>

<p>Having weak, underactive hormones seemingly is a common story for trans people.</p>

<p>Silver metal helps to clear brain fog and mental fatigue. Maybe it could help with mental retardation. In that same logic, mercury could help or even cause autism like syndromes.</p>

<br>

<p>Big countries eventually outsource and export the fields and companies that made them rich and built their culture to another country. This is the leisure phase leading into death phase.</p>
<br>

<p>Water and fire are the two elements of transmutation, the sun and moon in alchemy I think. Maybe repeated distillations via these two eventually yields true purifications of something down to its essence.</p>
<br>

<p>"Indeed, Earth is an alchemical vessel heated by the Sun & the internal fire, watered by the light of Moon and stars. We are among its alchemical products, taken toward higher stages in cyclical purges, until we ignite with etheric fire & become a jewel in the crown of creation." -Tom Montalk</p>

<p>Focusing on the mind enhances magical strength.</p>

<p>I think that the generations represent a cycle. Gen Z is at the bottom, winter or the most negative and yin. Then alpha is the rising generation of spring. But, in another way we could see boomers as solar/summer, X as autumn, Millennial as Winter and Z as spring. Similarly, in the original, Millennial would be autumn, X as summer and boomers as spring. In this way boomers would be analogous to gen alpha.</p>

<p>if and for statements seem to be the bread and butter of programming logic.</p>

<p>Capacitor block dc, inductor blocks ac.</p>
<br>

<p>"Capacitor and DC (Direct Current): A capacitor opposes changes in voltage. When a DC voltage is applied across a capacitor, it will initially act as a short circuit, allowing current to flow. As the capacitor charges up, the current flow will decrease, and eventually, the capacitor will block the DC current once it is fully charged. In this sense, a capacitor can be said to "block DC" in steady-state conditions.</p>

<p>Inductor and AC (Alternating Current): An inductor opposes changes in current. When an AC voltage is applied across an inductor, the inductor will impede the flow of current, as the changing current induces a magnetic field that generates a voltage opposing the change in current. The higher the frequency of the AC voltage, the greater the inductor's opposition to current flow (inductive reactance). In this sense, an inductor can be said to "block AC," especially at higher frequencies." -gabAi</p>

<p>You either die young or live long enough to consider buying a Volk**agon.</p>
<br>

<p>Imagine a machine that can turn "gravity" or natural weight into motion, rotation.</p>

 <h4>23/2/25</h4>
<br>

<p>I hear the young suffer from anxiety and the old suffer from depression.</p>
<br>

<p>Women psychically attack men in the genitals.</p>

<p>It's possible womens root organ is the genitals and mens is the brain.</p>
<br>

<p>I wonder if China has already won.</p>
<br>

<p>Accidents, things breaking and occurrences of bad luck are usually from an excess of tension or even unconscious relaxation in the body. The angle in which these energies are usually directly link to what will or has happened.</p>
<br>

<p>Your body adjusts its self to fit your current state.  People under a lot of stress have bodies that they view as unpleasant, but it is that way to deal with their lives. I guess it's similar to being depressed when having a bad life.</p>
<br>

 <h4>24/2/25</h4>
<br>

<p>I think when our bodies get the time to rest they switch to another mode where you start feeling a lot of pain in the body in order to heal and focus on it.</p>
<br>

<p>If you can get over the anxiety of doing something new then it becomes easy and routine.</p>
<br>

<p>People make it so hard when you're new at something. I don' get it. Why not just be supportive and nice?</p>
<br>

<p>I notice that the Italian tune up is legit. If you are too gentle and soft with your engine then it never learns to adjust to higher, pre redline rpms. Go down a gear or two and hold a higher rpm on the highway for a minute or two and see how much easier it revs.(Warm it up well first)</p>
<br>

 <h4>25/2/25</h4>
<br>

<p>Bad social experiences make you negative towards others and new experiences. That makes you an unpleasant person to be around who causes minor uncomfortable events to others. You gotta try to find a middle ground with holding boundaries against others but also having an openness to new experiences.</p>
<br>

<p>I learn best by doing, getting the feel for things. The more I do, the better I become.</p>
<br>

<p>One recipe for the stone - Add nitric acid to gold, heat for three months. Add spirit of sal ammoniac. Distill to an essence. Then add the essence to a "prima material"/"water of life" (More nitric acid?) and heat for another 3 months.(Postnote - This is just the chloride of gold I imagine? Some recipes for the stone seem to just be making mineral solvents and dissolving gold or cyclically refining mercury-sulfur-hydroxide back into cinnabar again)</p>

<p>It seems like the pure essence of metals poured upon molten metals seems to make them into the metal of the essence, that's what this is saying.</p>
<br>

<p>Randomness is how you invoke spiritual forces in your code. True randomness might be able to invoke God.</p>

<p>Milk is probably the easiest way to get nutrients and calories.</p>

 <h4>26/2/25</h4>
<br>

<p>Maybe all of these organic crystals(organic acids) are just everything distilled into its purest essence.</p>
<br>

<p>Crystalline vapor, crystalline spirit, spirit condensing into crystal. Maybe this is the prima materia or quintessence.</p>
<br>

<p>The boom of our era will probably come from crypto, robotics and AI.</p>
<br>

<p>If the older people had it so hard they wouldn't be such whiny little crybabies about everything.</p>
<br>

 <h4>27/2/25</h4>
<br>

<p>One day there will be 3d printed life forms/biological beings/animals.</p>
<br>

<p>Try not to make mistakes that you can't undo.</p>
<br>

<p>Working shit jobs and dealing with society teaches you how to handle stress.</p>
<br>

<p>The heart might sense and produce magical energy, aka electromagnetism. The lower body probably controls magnetism and the head, electrostatic.  It's possible that in the belly is emf and the lower body is magnetic while the heart is electrostatic, not sure.</p>

 <h4>28/2/25</h4>
<br>

<p>If the government's gonna piss away our money useless stuff. Why can't they piss it away on cool stuff like socialized race tracks?</p>
<br>

<p>If you want to apply your intellect to reality, then just think if you wanted to buy a house. You can first understand all of your options of renting, buying, building, etc. Then look into the price of each, look into all of the local areas you can buy at, look into building laws, etc. You have to be investigative you with your mind.</p>

<p>To apply your intelligence to the world, you need to understand all of the variables and factors. This means understanding your local and outside area. Know all of the commercial, residential, factory, farming and natural areas of it for example.</p>
