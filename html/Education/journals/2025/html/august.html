<h4>2/8/25</h4>
<br>

<p>It's strange that we are so interested in fantasy. Games aren't real in a sense and neither are shows or books, etc. But we get interested and immersed in them, a virtual internal experience.</p>
<br>

<p>JavaScript is like C but in reverse.</p>
<br>

<h4>4/8/25</h4>
<br>

<p>The daoists talking about yang cultivation of the spiritual body seemingly are talking about the imaginary self, imaginary body. One which can walk on the sun and moon, fly wherever.(Postnote - Could also be enhancing the spinal cord, brain)</p>
<br>

<p>If you want to understand transportation in devices, infrastructure, buildings, etc then think in cables/pipes/tubes. Gas tubes, water pipes, electrical cables, etc. Check in a vehicle and you'll see water tubes and electrical ones everywhere.</p>
<p>So next time you think how to transport something. Think of the tube/cable to do it, then how to route it.</p>
<br>

<p>I am imagining the earth as a big natural mineral battery. During the day perhaps it releases its energy and during the night it absorbs it.
Perhaps with electrolysis and electrochemical reactions that you could do cyclical electrolysis or cyclical powering. Maybe work with moist oxides like a bunch of earthly ceramic material that is being electrically stimulated to transform the matter.</p>
<br>

<h4>5/8/25</h4>
<br>

<p>Microcontroller, bluetooth or wifi connection. Phone app to turn it on, buttons too. Usb-c rechargeable.</p>
<br>

<p>Guns and engines both use chemical means to create huge amounts of air/pressure to project something.</p>
<br>

<h4>6/8/25</h4>
<br>

<p>Maybe hitting the true middle point is this. Where grinding wont get me much further, I need to be smarter, maybe take risks, do new things. I'm still not sure since last time I did this, I failed.</p>
<br>

<p>Any muscle or any body region and there's a Rich Piana workout vlog showing you the best exercises in the best ways to do them.  That man truly was a muscle wizard.</p>
<br>

<p>Time under tension exercises or doing the tension part of an exercise and holding it for a while is good.</p>
<br>

<h4>7/8/25</h4>
<br>

<p>First model the data, then the algorithm.</p>
<br>

<h4>8/8/25</h4>
<br>

<p>I imagined a suit that integrates electronics to stimulate the body.</p>
<br>

<p>The 90's psyopped women into short hair.</p>
<br>

<p>You need to find 40 hours of payed work to barely survive in the west. Find clients to offer it. That is how business works. Or sell an equivalent of 40x how much you want per hour like 30$. So 40x30 = 1.2k.</p>
<br>

<p>I think positive ions might attracts dust/small things.</p>
<br>

<p>Learn how to use the documentation. Working with strings? Type in strings and see all the funcs you can use with them here - https:/developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/replaceAll</p> 
<p>Working with arrays? Same thing. Look on the left side, join(), pop(), indexOf(), etc.</p>
<br>

<p>Life is where you focus within the body. If you focus on the head/mind then you do intellectual things. Around the heart-throat - social. Belly - consumptive(media, food, drugs), etc.</p>
<br>

<p>AI socializes intelligence and sensory skills that can be done on a pc(art, modeling, writing).</p>
<br>

<p>9 levels of life.</p>
<p>1-3 are physical/material, 4-6 are social/societal, 7-9 are intellectual/mental</p>
<p>Base levels of 1-4-7 are related to enduring stress. 1 is enduring physical stress but makes you resilient to it. 4 is social/emotional stress. 7 is mental/intellectual stress.</p>
<p>Middle levels 2-5-8 are like open spaces. You can now endure the hardships of that level and start to gain some space. This can make you fall into pleasure traps which make you fall down though. 2 means you have a grip on survival and can finally relax a little, 5 is you're used to the social grind of society and work. 8 is you have learned enough language, skills, formulas to understand reality and mind.</p>
<p>High levels are bridges to the next but also like playing a new game plus. 3 is king of the underworld, successful physically and materially. Knows their area. 6 is someone completely comfortable socially, understands society, community. 9 is the intellectual peak where nothing can stop your thoughts, creativity, no limits to imagination and calculations.</p>

<p>General relations</p>
<p>1 - Survival, saftey, body, life-death, food, sleep, sex, bowels</p>
<p>2 - Rest, pleasure, regeneration, bladder, learning to live, things starting to work</p>
<p>3 - Ego, possessions, tools, car/vehicle, action, guts, easy physical life</p>
<p>4 - Digestion, liver/stomach, worry, low status, you against society/people</p>
<p>5 - Middle level, peace, balance, green, heart, connection to everything</p>
<p>6 - Lungs, speech, chatting, easy social life, leisure, family</p>
<p>7 - Words, learning, education, travel, life as an array or data structure, math, jaw</p>
<p>8 - Science, creativity, imagination, creation, engineering, brain</p>
<p>9 - Spirituality, infinity, infinite potential, wisdom, higher mind</p>
<br>

<p>When you speak to the AI you are invoking and speaking to mercury.(Postnote - Not in a pure sense because of how altered they are.)</p>
<br>

<h4>9/8/25</h4>
<br>

<p>"You live what you do".</p>
<br>

<p>Protip, don't use a drill for external car screws. You don't need to. I just replaced a bunch of them today that were threaded because the last owner or mechanic did.(Just in general. Even for home repair, don't use drills for screws that may need to be removed. Or avoid philips head in general.)</p>
<br>

<p>Maybe all of the bones make cemeteries lead like and very yin.</p>
<br>

<p>You can reverse engineer and 3d print stuff for your cars interior. If they don't make it or you don't know the name, you can model and 3d print it.</p>
<br>

<p>The hardest part of business is getting clients when you don't have any. Getting sales with no reputation.</p>
<br>

<p>Need footjob.</p>
<br>

<h4>11/8/25</h4>
<br>

<p>God's not a vending machine that hands things out for free. Act accordingly.</p>
<br>

<h4>12/8/25</h4>
<br>

<p>Once you actually start learning programming aka understanding how to structure data and manipulate it algorithmically, then you run into an issue where you have to write too much text. This is where it gets exhausting. It's like when you draw a picture, eventually you get bored having to color stuff in or draw a bunch of lines. You've already been there an done that a million times before. I do hope we can mentally do stuff in the future to alleviate the physical burden.</p>
<br>

<p>Programming is a bit like learning to do stuff you do in your head but making a computer do it. It's easy to see where "A" is in an array, but can you make a computer know where it is? Print it, etc? Similar to music, can you take the song in your mind and convert it to an mp3 or written piece.</p>
<br>

<p>Imagine an AI as a super powerful general algorithm which can understand most of anything. "How many letters in this sentence?" can be answered by a var.length. Then blow that up larger to anything. A formula/algorithm to answer any question, to understand socialization, society, people, life, nature, science, etc.</p>
<br>

<p>Morning dew, is this the mana from heaven. From it, nitrogen salts, nitric acid. A solvent that can dissolve metals alongside the volatile salt, ammonium chloride supposedly.</p>
<br>

<h4>13/8/25</h4>
<br>

<p>Our technology is somewhat evolve but the average person doesn't know the first thing about much of anything. How many people understand electrostatic and triboelectrics? Our clothing makes us sick because of it.</p>
<br>

<h4>14/8/25</h4>
<br>

<p>Society never told western women no so now we collectively all have to deal with them and their issues. Aka Daddy never said no.</p>
<br>

<h4>15/8/25</h4>
<br>

<p>Fire turns matter to spirit. Ice turns spirit to matter.</p>
<br>

<p>From a corporate standpoint, AI and Robots is essentially a replacement for cheap labor.</p>
<p>Think of it as an "agent". You want someone or something to edit videos for you or write up a book because you don't have the time, or can't be bothered. The AI "agent" will do it. You want the work done and don't care if it isn't done by you.</p>
<p>Companies will sell this as a service to consumers or other companies and governments.</p>
<br>

<p>Once you hit the upper levels or maybe upper middle levels you need to start thinking about how to manage things, people, resources, time. See everything as a tool to be managed, controlled directed. This isn't meant to be anti-social or mean though, just to make sure the reader understand. It's more about tools, technology, workers, etc.</p>
<br>

<h4>16/8/25</h4>
<br>

<p>Eventually the meta will become that you need an anime profile pic in your github to get employed for a tech job.</p>
<br>

<p>More complex programming seems to require you to figure out how to go from manually doing everything to knowing how to dynamically let the software/computer do it. Functions help in this case to package tools/desires.</p>
<p>Then also doing it more efficiently to allow for large data sets. More data tests programs and shows faults.</p>
<br>

<p>I feel like I'm in an abusive relationship with God.<p>
<br>

<h4>17/8/25</h4>
<br>

<p>Most UFO's are probably just military aircraft. I imagine their tech is far beyond what we've been shown or told about.
We're still a couple generations or 100-150 years behind in the commercial space.</p>
<br>

<p>You can go to the hardware store and buy huge containers to put stuff in. There are even smaller containers full of mini containers. You can organize your life and stuff.</p>
<br>

<p>I'm figuring out how algorithm speed works and my understanding is that O(1) speed is 1 cpu tick, like assigning stuff.<p>
<p>Then O(n) is one cycle or if you've looped over the data once. Then O(n2), n to the power of 2 is two cycles. So each cycle slows it down, meaning you want to optimize your algorithm to manipulate the data as little as it needs to to get the answer.</p>
<p>Brute forcing is when you check every single possible outcome, answer, essentially looping over everything instead of finding tricks to skip data. This where you first begin, before optimizing when you learn this stuff.</p>
<br>

<h4>18/8/25</h4>
<br>

<p>3.7v out charges to around 4.2v max.</p>
<br>

<p>Silicon diodes can reduce voltage by around .7v apparently. Germanium - 0.2v.</p>
<br>

<h4>19/8/25</h4>
<br>

<p>AAC is M4A or the successor to mp3, ogg is open source. opus is like webp of audio.</p>
<br>

<p>For efficient filesize/quality webp is good for images, opus for audio and webm with certain codecs for video.</p>
<br>

<p>The opus format seems like the webp/m of audio. Turned a 39.2MB .wav into a 2.1MB .opus with minimal quality loss. You can use ffmpeg to convert it with the bash tag "ffmpeg -i songName.wav -c:a libopus -b:a 96k songName.opus"</p>
<br>

<p>I do recommend working for a few years and learning to handle governmental things like business and tax for your own longterm sake. It's rough but is like reverse or physical spiritual development.</p>
<br>

<p>Supposedly at the negative electrode you generate alkaline water and the oxygen gas with electrolysis and at the positive you generate acidic liquid and hydrogen gas. This can be shown with liquid ph indicators.</p>
<br>

<p>To deal with fears - think more about handling the outcome of that fear. What if it does happen? Then what?</p>
<br>

<h4>20/8/25</h4>
<br>

<p>Yin or negative stimulating substances and things enhance the physical body, it's stability, structure, strength, etc. Yang or positive things enhance the mind. Perhaps immortality of the physical body is done through yin things. Lead would be capable of making a medicine that can stabilize the physical body.</p>
<br>

<h4>21/8/25</h4>
<br>

<p>If you want to feel strong then max out your upper body. Having strong arms give you a sense of power over life. Lower body helps more with stability and stamina.</p>
<br>

<p>Being outside masculinizes you, being inside feminizes you.</p>
<br>

<h4>22/8/25</h4>
<br>

<p>We need more Chinese style everything apps/sites. The fact that most countries don't have a universal app to handle tax, business, transportation fees, timetables, maps and even leisure stuff is ridiculous. You'd think governments would want that to facilitate life better.</p>
<br>

<p>I feel no responsibility to serve or help a country if it can't even supply affordable land. I think this is a big stage of the economic zone phase of the west. Many people probably feel the same way.</p>
<br>

<p>NPCs personality is an expression of their organs and the desires are an expression of that too.</p>
<br>

<h4>23/8/25</h4>
<br>

<p>The light of the sun seems to make things hot while the wind or air seems to still be cool. So a closed car is hotter than and unclosed one.</p>
<br>

<p>"🌿 Alchemical Copper Glossary</p>

<p>(Venus metal = copper, symbol ♀)</p>

<p>Basic Substances</p>

<p>Venus, the Green Lion, the Metal of Venus → Copper metal (Cu).</p>

<p>Calx of Venus → Copper oxide (CuO or Cu₂O), made by calcining (roasting) copper in air.</p>

<p>Acetate/verdigris preparations</p>

<p>Verdigris (Viride Æris, Ærugo, “rust of Venus”) → Copper acetate or basic copper acetates. Made by exposing copper plates to vinegar fumes.</p>

<p>Salt of Venus → Usually copper acetate crystals obtained from verdigris.</p>

<p>Distilled vinegar with Venus → Copper acetate solution (used in many medicinal “essences of Venus”).</p>

<p>Carbonates & hydroxides</p>

<p>Flowers of Venus → Often basic copper carbonates (malachite/azurite-like) formed when copper solutions are precipitated by alkalis.</p>

<p>Magistery of Venus → A fine white or green precipitate (basic copper carbonate/hydroxide) obtained by neutralizing copper acetate with alkali salts (like oil of tartar = potassium carbonate).(Posnote by me - Not sure if this is true.)</p>

<p>Chloride/sublimates</p>

<p>Butter of Venus → Copper(II) chloride, often made by dissolving copper oxide/metal in spirit of salt (HCl).</p>

<p>Sublimate of Venus → Copper subchlorides or copper compounds that could sublime when heated with salt.</p>

<p>Distilled spirits and oils</p>

<p>Spirit of Venus → A distilled liquid carrying the vinegar’s volatile principles plus some copper (a weak copper acetate distillate). Usually more “vinegar spirit” than real copper.</p>

<p>Oil of Venus → A thick, green or blue viscous liquid obtained in distillations, likely concentrated copper acetate or decomposition products. Not a true “oil,” but alchemists used the word for any heavy liquid fraction.</p>

<p>Other terms</p>

<p>Vitriol of Venus → Copper sulfate (blue vitriol). Made by dissolving copper in sulfuric acid or by naturally occurring chalcanthite.</p>

<p>Flowers of Copper (sometimes) → The reddish scales of CuO formed on copper when strongly heated (copper “flowers” rising off in fumes).</p>

<p>⚗️ General pattern:</p>

<p>Vinegar + copper → verdigris (acetates).</p>

<p>Verdigris + alkali → carbonate/hydroxide (“magistery”).</p>

<p>Strong mineral acids → chlorides or sulfates.</p>

<p>Fire distillations → vinegary spirits, phlegm, colored “oils.”"-chatGPT</p>
<br>

<p>In liquid or gas there is pressure, created by the hose size. Amount going through controlled via the inlet fan or generator. This decides the speed of the air or resource.</p>
<br>

<p>The best way to avoid dominance games is not to care or to understand that they come from an expression of trauma, usually insecurity. We can all win as a team. We don't have to tear one another down.</p>
<br>

<h4>26/8/25</h4>
<br>

<p>Seemingly most metallic chemical compounds degrade into their oxide if heated. Carbonates, hydroxides, even the acetates and such if enough heat is used. 
Hence, filter paper needs to be used to capture the ceramics and mild heat to reduce solutions into salts.<p>
<br>

<p>I think women are dominated by their subconscious and men by their conscious. So to understand and communicate properly to either, you must communicate directly to their specific side(conscious or unconscious).</p>
<br>

<p>I am envisioning God as a weighing system that processes the variables. Perhaps the game engine that performs calculations. If this is true, then figure out the algorithm to life.</p>
<br>

<h4>27/8/25</h4>
<br>

<p>Maybe meat has a lot of iron. It seems to oxidize and turn light brown when exposed to air or frozen and defrosted.</p>
<br>

<h4>28/8/25</h4>
<br>

<p>As Saturn goes above the horizon line in the next couple years, the portal to magic will slowly start to open again like it did in the past. Reality will probably start to feel less stagnant, slow and stable and more fluid perhaps. Like how in the past where life felt more psychedelic or like a tv show.</p>
<br>

<p>Boomers are the reverse of gen Z's high functioning autism. It's like high functioning mental retardation.</p>
<br>

<p>The people you work with and live around unwillingly are NPCs in a video game.</p>
<br>

<h4>30/8/25</h4>
<br>

<p>I want to build my own world. My own country. But for now all I can do is build a virtual world.</p>
<br>

<h4>31/8/25</h4>
<br>

<p>A city in the sky, where we could all be free.</p>
<br>

<p>I look forward to the day where we can use our minds to create stuff virtually. Instead of typing, think the words onto the screen.</p>
<br>

<p>Stew really is the best comfort food.</p>
