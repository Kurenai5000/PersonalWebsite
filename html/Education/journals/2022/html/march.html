<h4>1/3/22</h4>

<p>There are three sides to every story, the narrative, counter narrative and the truth.</p>
<br>
<h4>4/3/22</h4>

<p>Programming really is the control and manipulation of data.</p>

<p>-Can raw data create a life form similar to human consciousness? Perhaps we act similarly to quantized data. The consciousness is the part which goes beyond this and thinks about the data. "Am I really hungry? What do I want to eat?"</p>

<p>Logic within logic. So many forms of logic within logic, cycles of logic. Triggers that trigger different cycles. Behavior patterns are another thing. Mapping this in a 3D environment so that the avatar could walk, sit, drink water, eat food, etc and have bodily functions is one thing. That'd take them beyond just their mind. Though if I can create a mind then making a body wouldn't be too hard.</p>
<br>
<h4>6/3/22</h4>

<p>Excessive development of the head and mind without that of the body is detrimental. You need a strong physical life first. A lot of basic physical jobs are easy and just require a lot of stamina while the higher level mental jobs require more mind. The head gives more sensory abilities.</p>
<br>
<h4>9/3/22</h4>

<p>Reality has become hyper complex and requires as much brains as brawn.</p>
<br>
<p>I think having fuckloads of cash lets you level up quick in society/reality.</p>
<br>
<h4>11/3/22</h4>

<p>Be careful what you think, some others are psychic.</p>
<br>
<h4>13/3/22</h4>

<p>Roads are made from heaviest at the bottom and lightest on the top. Also biggest to most subtle material or fine. Course to fine.</p>
<br>
<h4>17/3/22</h4>

<p>Having magic changes you, changes your body. Having magic means having mental consciousness. It allows you to enhance acts, to direct life.
Thinking for example can be enhanced with magic energy or consciousness, focus.</p>
<br>
<p>There was a story about the government doing something near Terry Davis's grave where supposedly his brain might've been taken and stored.</p>
<br>
<h4>18/3/22</h4>

<p>99% of violence is posturing/fake.</p>
<br>
<h4>21/3/22</h4>

<p>Being a young man is like being out in the woods where you've got no gear and no way home and need to find a way to either conquer it or die.
Some only partly conquer the woods and spend their resources on pleasure with the elves and faries who offer comfort and relaxation.</p>
<br>
<h4>24/3/22</h4>

<p>Don't do important things on low hours of sleep.</p>
<br>
<h4>26/3/22</h4>

<p>-In the coming age of light, we will need to re-establish tradition and boundaries. We'll reinstate order in the world, the traditional family structures which built and maintained society and created healthy children. Re-creating the industry of manufacturing and resource production in order to be self sufficient and handy.</p>

<p>We'll purify the corrupt science and religious institutions in order to re-establish truth, wisdom and the force of God within the world.
It's going to be a lot of work but it's our duty to navigate and drive reality to its proper course in order to avoid the ruin which is within our fields today.</p>
<br>
<h4>27/3/22</h4>

<p>War and conflict draws up all of your sexual energy and uses it as adrenaline.</p>
<br>
<h4>28/3/22</h4>

<p>To make good communities we the people need to protect, moderate and discipline within it.</p>
<br>
<p>The imagination is kinda like a virtual machine where you simulate things.</p>
<br>
<h4>30/3/22</h4>

<p>The yin phases is how you acquire more experiences, the yang phases is when you express and put those experiences down into books or stories.</p>
<br>
<h4>31/3/22</h4>

<p>Martial arts training is training people for when they experience violence.</p>
<br>
<p>The problem with western school teaching is that we're always looking at models instead of the real thing.</p>
<br>
<p>The soul(or spirit) force is the force from the heart area/lungs.</p>
