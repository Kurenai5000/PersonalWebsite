<p>Crystals are a form of glass. Perhaps the silica and oxygen molecules signify it as a glass. So then that might be the
body. Understanding glass forming would be how to convert crystals to bigger ones or to turn mineral salts into crystals in order to color them.</p>
<br>
<p>Being in routine and society, work is the mother or matrix. It is feminine while being more creative, going outside of the current is masculine, the outside world.</p>

<p>You make yourself weak by targeting someones weakness. Fight them as if they were perfect to learn to fight a perfect enemy.</p>
<br>
<p>"i just want to mention this technology uses high pressure as well - the technology was actually invented at Bell Laboratories in the 1950's. Quartz rocks are dissolved in sodium hydroxide and water at high temperatures in a high pressure vessel. As temperature is lowered the silicon dioxide molecules fall out of solution and auto assemble onto seed crystals. The process can be repeated to make the crystals more pure - (pressure vessel washed and crystals redissolved and recrystallized). It took many years to perfect the technology." -Youtube comment on making crystals I think</p>

<p>-"The teachings of the Hui-ming ching are concrete and straightforward. They can be summarized as follows:</p>

<p>1. When we were in our mother’s womb, we were filled with the primordial energy of the Tao. In the natal state, original nature and the energy of life are united.</p>

<p>2. At birth we come into contact with the world. When air is inhaled through the nostrils, the primordial breath within is contaminated and the connection with the Tao is broken. Original nature and life energy separate, the former moving to the heart and the latter moving to the kidneys.</p>

<p>3. At puberty, sexual desire is aroused. When the primordial life force is transformed into procreative energy, it begins to leak out of the body. The leakage of life energy is the primary cause of aging, illness, and premature death.</p>

<p>4. If the leakage is stopped and the procreative energy is drawn back into the body, the energy will be transformed into the primordial vapor of the Tao. When there are no openings for the vapor of life to escape, it will circulate through the Microcosmic Orbit in the body. In the Hui-ming ching, this circuit is called the Dharmic Wheel.</p>

<p>5. With time, enough vapor will gather to form a bundle of energy in the lower tan-t’ien. This bundle of energy is the spirit-fetus.</p>

<p>6. The spirit-fetus is nourished by the primordial vapor until it is mature. This process is called the incubation of the fetus.</p>

<p>7. When the spirit-fetus is ready to be born, it will exit the body at the top of the head. Manifesting as multiple entities, the spirit becomes omniscient and the practitioner can see the past and the future.</p>

<p>8. Initially, the spirit-child hovers around the head of the practitioner. But as it matures, it will travel farther and farther from the shell that conceived it. In its journey to the different realms of existence, it will learn how to return to the Tao.</p>

<p>9. Finally, when the spirit has completed its training, the practitioner willingly gives up the shell to liberate the spirit for its final return to the Tao"</p>
