<h4>3/6/22</h4>

<p>Education games are the next best thing after courses.</p>
<br>
<p>Relaxing and letting energy go low is feeding the lower elements in the body.</p>
<br>
<p>Learning to harvest materials and build shit is probably a more fruitful endeavor than paying for it nowadays.</p>
<br>
<p>Studying stuff lets you understand it on a mental level. Once you've studied it lots then you need to practice it to properly understand and know how to use it.</p>
<br>
<h4>4/6/22</h4>

<p>If you remove peoples ability to own land then you reduce them into slaves.</p>
<br>
<p>Building up the root is building the foundation in the body.</p>
<br>
<h4>7/6/22</h4>

<p>Relax your top head to become enlightened.</p>
<br>
<h4>8/6/22</h4>

<p>Broth is simmering ingredients in water to get their oil and salt components and essences.</p>
<br>
<h4>9/6/22</h4>

<p>If you aren't happy with what you're getting out of life then plant new seeds.</p>
<br>
<p>Focus in the head to understand things more.</p>
<br>
<p>Most spiritual sources of energy are renewable. We are shifting more to spiritual sources of energy rather than physical.</p>
<br>
<p>Aetheric energy might relate to the throat or mind.</p>
<br>
<h4>10/6/22</h4>

<p>I think back pain is a kidney deficiency.</p>
<br>
<h4>12/6/22</h4>

<p>Pea soup is good.</p>
<br>
<h4>13/6/22</h4>

<p>Jing is gathered through sleep and meat, it is used in physical exercise and physical stuff. It is vitality. Qi is used normally in life and in social interaction - being heart energy. Shen is mental energy, gathered as the night falls it starts to rise. You can get it via yin substances like sugar, drugs, tobacco. It's used doing mental activities.</p>
<br>
<h4>16/6/22</h4>

<p>All things are a measure of degrees. Don't wish for miracles, make them happen through daily practice.</p>
<br>
<p>Learn to circulate the blood through the body. Focus on the pulse and then enhance it.</p>
<br>
<h4>18/6/22</h4>

<p>There are slow and quick forms of entertainment. If you get too addicted to the fast forms then you loose your attention span, root and ability to focus on the slower ones.</p>
<br>
<h4>19/6/22</h4>

<p>The magic circuit in the body is probably the nerves. Magic, the controller, the nerves and mind. The mind and nerves is the controller of the body. It moves large force with small forces.</p>
<br>
<h4>20/6/22</h4>

<p>AI is getting to the stage where it can be used to assist your imagination similar to how it assists our memories and thought.</p>
<br>
<h4>22/6/22</h4>

<p>"The alchemist’s vocabulary does not always translate directly into a modern formula. They were keen on Natron, which was a generic word that included both the salts of sodium carbonate and sodium nitrate. Vitriol, however, is what we know as sulphuric acid and Aqua Fortis was nitric acid. Black pulvis solaris was formed from ground black antimony (stibnite–a sulphide of antimony) mixed with ground sulphur. Red pulvis solaris was a mixture of mercury (which could be extracted by heating cinnabar) and sulphur."</p>
<br>
<p>“This connection between red mercuric oxide and the formation of gold would convince later alchemists that Red Pulvis Solaris was indeed the powder of projection that would enable them to transform virtually anything into pure gold.”</p>
<br>
<h4>23/6/22</h4>

<p>Spirit in older words can be a word for energy.</p>
<br>
<p>Hydrochloric acid can be made from sulphuric acid poured over salt, then distilled apparently. Nitric is made from sulphuric over saltpetre or sodium/potassium nitrate. Aqua regia is made from 1 parts nitric, 3 parts hydrochloric.</p>
<br>
<h4>24/6/22</h4>

<p>From water comes salt and then when this dries, forms earth. So from water all things come.</p>
<br>
<p>Maybe the joke about mercury, salt and sulfur making a stone isn't a joke.</p>
<br>
<p>If you heat most crystals enough you can get their water, their acid or air chemical and then get an oxide to make metal from.</p>
<br>
<h4>26/6/22</h4>

<p>A spagyric vessel is seen as a uterus.</p>
<br>
<p>Astral world, world of light.</p>
<br>
<p>Perhaps then we live in the world of darkness where physical matter is. The light world is where it is a virtualization and subtle image.</p>
<br>
<h4>29/6/22</h4>

<p>I pray for the world who needs it more than I.</p>
<br>
<p>Doing stuff uses your heat energy. Body heat is the vital life force.</p>
<br>
<p>Relaxing lets you build up more heat inside of you.</p>
<br>
<h4>30/6/22</h4>

<p>Being around the vaccinated makes you sick.</p>
<br>
<p>The two energies - From the air which you breathe and from the earth that you connection to. Connect to these two to gain energy.</p>
<br>
<p>Do you want to live in a self created world or a mass manufactured world.</p>
