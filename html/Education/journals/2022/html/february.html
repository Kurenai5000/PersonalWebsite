<h4>2/2/22</h4>

<p>Ginko is very good herb.</p>
<br>
<h4>4/2/22</h4>

<p>What is fire? Some kind of transmutational medium or function that converts substances to their spiritual form? Usually a transmutation of refined substances like oils or volatile liquids.</p>
<br>
<h4>5/2/22</h4>

<p>Womens voice is cooling/cold, mens is warm.</p>
<br>
<p>I think the girls I like the most remind me of myself.</p>
<br>
<h4>6/2/22</h4>

<p>Being tense is yang. Relaxed is yin.</p>
<br>
<p>Main levels of learning.</p>
<p>0 - Reading/familiarizing/planting seeds/foundation</p>
<p>1 - Practice/exercises/basics</p>
<p>2 - Trying out on your own/creation</p>
<br>
<h4>7/2/22</h4>

<p>-An ai mind - There would be three levels. 1. Master level that modifies everything and changes the mid and lower levels. 2. Thought and imagination layer which internally computes and visualizes. 3. Third layer of external voicing, speaking of what the internal layers represent. </p>

<p>Essentially the mind is just a computer so to speak, the higher mind controls and imposes upon this like a king imposing upon the people or a puppet master imposing upon the king.</p>
<br>

<p>Orgonite - metal and quartz in fibreglass resin. I wonder if cement can work. Plastic film and aluminum foil are orgone items.</p>
<br>
<h4>8/2/22</h4>

<p>"The essence of magic is to determine the root cause of all things. There's no distinction between science and magic."</p>
<br>
<p>Add salt to blunt acidity.</p>
<br>
<p>"To achieve enlightenment, match your breath with that of the world. You will obtain the way of heaven."</p>
<br>
<p>To have a strong body you must have strong legs. Horse stance helps this.</p>
<br>
<h4>9/2/22</h4>

<p>People who've fallen to the darkness will try to torment you in order to get you to fall as well. Truthfully they're miserable and can only gain joy from destroying others.</p>
<br>
<p>Mercury Arc Rectifier - converts AC to DC.</p>
<br>
<h4>10/2/22</h4>

<p>If you have cancer in the body, it spreads. Similarly cancer spreads in a society.</p>
<br>
<p>The spirit and the body can be different. You can have a strong big man with a soft personality for example.</p>
<br>
<h4>11/2/22</h4>

<p>Anti depressants stop you from dealing with your trauma.</p>
<br>
<h4>12/2/22</h4>

<p>As an artist I have an obsession with beauty. Women represent the most beautiful being or thing in this world.</p>
<br>
<p>Martial arts is the expression of power and strength in a refined form while arts is that of beauty.</p>
<br>
<h4>13/2/22</h4>

<p>Don't seek approval from others or the adoration and love of them. Just do your own cool stuff.</p>
<br>
<h4>15/2/22</h4>

<p>I could feel a cold yin aura when talking about things that I think was uncomfortable to others around me today when working.</p>
<br>
<h4>19/2/22</h4>

<p>I saw the dark spirit of light exit a spiders body when I squished it. It was on the same level of vision as those spiritual lights that appear due to thoughts from other people.</p>
<br>
<h4>20/2/22</h4>

<p>Instead of war, countries are conquered by either mass immigration or economic purchasing of their land and businesses in the modern age.</p>
<br>
<p>Videos can let us experience something without doing it. So it's a bit like how the rich man invests into companies that he likes.</p>
<br>
<h4>21/2/22</h4>

<p>Supposedly the high ass power lines generate free energy from the air. They lead to a substation that stores and manages it and leads it back to houses.</p>
<br>
<h4>22/2/22</h4>

<p>Robo-maids will be a lucrative business venture.</p>
<br>
<h4>24/2/22</h4>

<p>Don't redpill people, expect them to already be.</p>
<br>
<p>Societies are somewhat of a competitive thing. There's a tension pot where everyone is pressing against everyone else. If you're too weak to handle the work then you get shifted out, removed. You either die or find a new job. You go down or up the ladder. Society is brutal but it's just the same brutal world as before, nothing has changed in that way.</p>
<br>
<p>Similarly how cultivating the root allows you to control physical external reality, cultivating the crown lets you control mental reality.</p>
<br>
<h4>25/2/22</h4>

<p>Plants grow strong and then flower and seed when they've built themselves up. They also do it in a special season.</p>
<br>
<h4>26/2/22</h4>

<p>Lvl 0 homeless, lvl 1 housed free, lvl 2 welfare, lvl 3 immigrant gig jobs, lvl 4 peasant job, lvl 5 average wage job, lvl 6 above average wage job, lvl 7 high position job, lvl 8 small time CEO, lvl 9 CEO, lvl 10 Big business CEO.</p>
<br>
<p>When pain, loss, failure and suffering is more emotionally powerful than success, joy and happiness you are fucked up. This is the state that a lot of people are in. They'd rather tear things down and get the buzz from that than build them up.</p>
<br>
<h4>28/2/22</h4>

<p>Wizards - masters of aether, understanders of the stars, they who work with cosmic energies.</p>
<br>
<p>Mana is head energy and health is body energy.</p>
<br>
<p>Online courses and online game based education will be the future of learning.</p>
<br>
<p>I think a lot of people don't experience the middle or lower parts of life as much today so they blow up quickly and get an easy life, hence they continue to lack a true foundation.</p>
