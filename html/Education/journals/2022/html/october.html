<h4>1/10/22</h4>

<p>Iron apparently hinders magnetism while copper does not.</p>
<br>
<h4>2/10/22</h4>

<p>Consistency + Work * Time = Success. So put in more work or time if you want more results. Maybe Effort * Time = Success or work results.</p>
<br>
<p>"Mana (mind), buddhi (intellect), smruti (memory), bhakti (desire), sheela (temperament), chesta (psychomotor activity) and achara (conduct)"</p>
<br>
<h4>3/10/22</h4>

<p>Spirit manifests down into salt. I think plants or animals or even minerals that have lived longer and have more physical energy have more minerals, those crystals in their bone/flesh/wood.</p>
<br>
<h4>4/10/22</h4>

<p>Stimulation - new stuff inflames the soul and keeps you awake. Otherwise you fall into sleep, death.</p>
<br>
<h4>7/10/22</h4>

<p>If someone makes you feel bad continuously for no good reason then they are a bad person. Get them out of your life.</p>
<br>
<h4>8/10/22</h4>

<p>Give people space or silence when you want them to talk.</p>
<br>
<h4>9/10/22</h4>

<p>Crude sulfur is the coagulated fat of the earth. There seems to be metallic class elements and earthly class stuff like dirt and sand.</p>
<br>
<h4>10/10/22</h4>

<p>The original matter held everything, it separated into two and then those two merged and made a third. These again continued to separate based on density and intermingle to create new compounds according to the cycle of energy and season, temperature or other which occurred until the world we know today was created.</p>
<br>
<h4>12/10/22</h4>

<p>I think when the women in a mans family or life reject him socially he develops issues with women and when the men in a woman's family or life reject her she develops male issues.</p>
<br>
<h4>16/10/22</h4>

<p>Perhaps a philosophers stone can be made from blood.</p>
<br>
<h4>17/10/22</h4>

<p>When you heat something up it turns to vapor/gas. What if you then held this gas in a chamber and continued to heat it. Would this cause it to transmute to higher elements?</p>
<br>
<p>A universal language could be made through emojis.</p>
<br>
<p>A priest/priestess can calm and disengage spirits that possess and haunt people.</p>
<br>
<h4>18/10/22</h4>

<p>When the plant lifts up its energy to the crown and flowers(flowers and seeds being the crown of the plant) it starts to die, depending on the plant. Trees don't die, they retain some energy in their roots.</p>
<br>
<p>The brain has an AI like function that lets you create random stuff out of an idea or on/along an idea. This is the subconscious mind.</p>
<br>
<h4>19/10/22</h4>

<p>I think we're like batteries. We charge during the night and expend during the day.</p>
<br>
<h4>20/10/22</h4>

<p>Low wattage electronics are safer for your health. Also wired internet instead of wifi.</p>
<br>
<p>Oldworld tech is just simple technology.</p>
<br>
<p>Alchemy is kinda just like simple chemistry but within that is immense wisdom.</p>
<br>
<p>Similarly the oldworld electrical tech is far simpler and easier to use.</p>
<br>
<h4>21/10/22</h4>

<p>Medicine stimulates the organ it helps or the faculty it helps. So too much heart medicine can actually cause heart issues but just enough stimulates it. Then it is a question of whether you're stimulating heat or coolness, moisture or dryness, purging or gathering, physical or spiritual.</p>
<br>
<p>Clear the heart to ease guilt.</p>
<br>
<p>The scorn or mental curse of spiritual people is far stronger than that of baser folk.</p>
<br>
<p>Apparently mercury can harvest atmospheric energy.</p>
<br>
<h4>22/10/22</h4>

<p>Be careful with them liberal women.</p>
<br>
<h4>23/10/22</h4>

<p>Bigger pc is bigger brain and smaller body. Smaller pc is smaller brain and bigger body.</p>
<br>
<p>Faith in God is energy in the upper head.</p>
<br>
<p>Base = sweet, tip = spicy. Supposedly this is for radishes.</p>
<br>
<h4>24/10/22</h4>

<p>-I think clearer liquids like water, vinegar, ammonia, acids and alcohols pull from solids. Then other liquids have a lot of energy or salty matter in them like piss, soup or juice where it deposits into crystal or oil form. So a super saturation or just a living, full fluid with lots of positive charge instead of negative.</p>

<p>Over time the positive fluid will deposit matter in the form of salt or white powdery material. Similarly the negative fluids will draw overtime the oils/essence and salts from physical things.</p>
<br>
<h4>25/10/22</h4>

<p>Occultic wisdom is wisdom of the root , the lower areas. You have to go through darkness and trauma and the harshness of reality in order to uncover and find it out.</p>
<br>
<p>I think the head has a lot to do with magic and mana. Perhaps the energy is produced there and controlled there so regular people don't have much of a strong head.</p>
<br>
<p>Every time you invest time, money, energy, etc on something, you level up your perspective and know more. It opens up your view to a larger idea about it.</p>
<br>
<h4>26/10/22</h4>

<p>Keeping things preserved through time from today to tomorrow is to preserve them from moisture, light, temperature, kinetic vibration and shock.</p>
<br>
<h4>27/10/22</h4>

<p>Sometimes you need to loose something or do something new to realize how the old truly meant something to you and was better.</p>
<br>
<p>Running water draws energy.</p>
<br>
<p>There is a small amount of energy in the air in a spiritual form. Perhaps this would be some kind of salt that is evaporated. It could be condensed and we also breathe it in and can regain our earth from the tiny bits of it.</p>
<br>
<p>Perhaps eating dirt is kind of like drinking water but for the earth element.</p>
<br>
<p>Circulate the energy from food or air through the body and ground it in the body in order to save/invest your spiritual energies and heal yourself.</p>
<br>
<h4>28/10/22</h4>

<p>Circulate to the whole body in order to remove fear and issues.</p>
<br>
<p>If your aura is not up then others can dig into you and attack you easily.</p>
<br>
<h4>29/10/22</h4>

<p>Roger Caro: The Complete Great Work Photographed Cinnabar and potassium hydroxide. Or mercury, sulfur and salt.</p>
<br>
<h4>30/10/22</h4>

<p>Books - Frater T.P.S., Lenny Pedersen, Roger Caro - The Via, Cinnabaris of the F. A. R. +C., roger-caro-the-complete-great-work-photographed-the- complete-great-work-photographed</p>
<br>
<p>If a stone can be made from mercury then perhaps other metals as well can be used to transmutate stuff.</p>
<br>
<p>Perhaps then the mixtures of various metallic and earthly things like how the old sages did in Chinese alchemy can transmute.</p>
<br>
<p>Void energy is a lack of focus.</p>
