<h4>1/5/22</h4>

<p>Enliven the mind to gain inspiration.</p>
<br>
<p>Time and space physics is probably related to aether. Maybe gravity too.</p>
<br>
<p>Blood building pills are good for exercise recovery.</p>
<br>
<h4>2/5/22</h4>

<p>When tormented by stress or illness then meditate or rest.</p>
<br>
<p>If Radio waves can be used to read human emotions, then probably they can also be used to send emotions. So this could give robots emotions.</p>
<br>
<h4>4/5/22</h4>

<p>1. 凡人 - Mortal, 2. 练气 - Qi refining, 3. 筑基 - Foundation building, 4. 金丹 - Golden centre</p>
<br>
<p>I think to fix the modern dating scene you just need to enforce monogamy and take away any child welfare benefits or aid to reinstate fathers in the relationship.</p>
<br>
<p>Three dan tiens, three classes of society. Lower class is much more physical, middle class is very social/societal, upper is very mental.</p>
<br>
<h4>6/5/22</h4>

<p>Ginger and cinnamon is good to keep you warm.</p>
<br>
<p>Avoiding eye contact is a great way to avoid interfacing with other people. So then eye contact is a good way "to" interface with others.</p>
<br>
<p>Convert breath to blood. Is that converting qi to vital energy?</p>
<br>
<h4>7/5/22</h4>

<p>Water relates a lot psychically. Countries that are always cloudy and moist are probably more psychic.</p>
<br>
<p>The lunar force recycles souls because they end up in the prostate, womb and gonads of people.</p>
<br>
<h4>9/5/22</h4>

<p>Apparently “they” can make you hear voices in your head with microwaves. So one frequency range is mental, another is emotional, then the next is physical.</p>
<br>
<p>Men get addicted to games because it stimulates work.</p>
<br>
<h4>10/5/22</h4>

<p>Work is necessary for men to overcome challenge and ascend in life.</p>
<br>
<h4>11/5/22</h4>

<p>Circulate through the body from the dan tien.</p>
<br>
<p>Electronic smell and taste devices might made be with plasma.</p>
<br>
<p>The magnetic source is the lower dan tien.</p>
<br>
<h4>13/5/22</h4>

<p>I think the ice age correlates with the age of Capricorn and beyond perhaps?</p>
<br>
<h4>15/5/22</h4>

<p>Heart is a very good meat. Large animal organs are good, they're like meat. Better than smaller animal organs.</p>
<br>
<h4>16/5/22</h4>

<p>Spirit arts, using spiritual energy and intention to cause effect in reality.</p>
<br>
<p>When someone is young, inexperienced and without any home or belongings and ability to gain them, they need to be aided by a group, family, etc. I believe in this age that the old have not cared about the young and just expected them to work out, but instead they are miserable and unable to grow up.</p>
<br>
<p>Intellectual arts(language, magic, philosophy). Social (business/selling, relationships) and physical (martial, body movement, craft, farming).</p>
<br>
<h4>17/5/22</h4>

<p>Perhaps the ages can be created by strong people who then influence the culture of that age.</p>
<br>
<h4>19/5/22</h4>

<p>If you need energy then do exercises.</p>
<br>
<p>Focus on not taking in bad energies.</p>
<br>
<h4>20/5/22</h4>

<p>Scorpio is the dense water. The deepest depths of the ocean or is that Pisces?</p>
<br>
<h4>22/5/22</h4>

<p>Sell everything that you don't and won't need.</p>
<br>
<p>Don't bother with people or places that don't value discussion but instead just angry arguments.</p>
<br>
<h4>24/5/22</h4>

<p>Programming is the core skill while art is the supplementary skill.</p>
<br>
<h4>25/5/22</h4>

<p>Maybe crude anti gravity can be done through air like a propeller blade.</p>
<br>
<p>Dwarf lilly turf is a yin herb that apparently lets you go without water.</p>
<br>
<p>Supposedly in countries without abortion the people are more chaste.</p>
<br>
<h4>26/5/22</h4>

<p>Skills and the ability to do things, especially alone will be what's valued in the future.</p>
<br>
<p>The economy can no longer support useless eaters, people who don't do anything at their job.</p>
<br>
<p>Fermentation is external digestion.</p>
<br>
<p>The animating force of matter is the force of God. It's what allows for movement, action. It rests in the center of your head.</p>
<br>
<p>Women are becoming desperate for marriage. I believe their value is starting to drop. The housing market is starting to crash.</p>
<br>
<h4>28/5/22</h4>

<p>Already in year 2000 society was in a dark age of degeneracy.</p>
<br>
<h4>30/5/22</h4>

<p>Study and practice. Study is to understand something mentally while practice is to do it physically.</p>
<br>
<p>The dark intelligence is more of a physical intuition, a feeling while the white intelligence is more of a mental, visual, to see things.</p>
<br>
<p>Because a lot of the lower labor has been shipped overseas, the young here are not able to develop and grow in the lower areas which they need for reality.</p>
<br>
<p>Salty herbs are the vitality herbs. They probably are good after a long workout or hard day to recover vigor.</p>
