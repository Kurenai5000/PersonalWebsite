<p>A key tenant of masculinity is grinding up the hierarchy. The higher you are the more access to life you have.</p>
<br>
<p>Everything has a hierarchy.</p>
<br>
<p>Assumably women instinctively notice where a man is on the hierarchy. Though this does not always mean a good man or proper man if he is higher up.</p>

<p>The priest class is the nervous system and brain, the warriors are the body. Then further dividing, the king is the crown, nobles maybe the throat, merchants the heart or belly, peasants the root.</p>
<br>
<h4>11/9/22</h4>

<p>Menopause is when a woman can't have a period. This leads me to think that it is related to the hormones and womb. That the woman has a very weakened and dry root and or sacaral chakra. So then aging would relate to those chakras.</p>
<br>
<p>The full moon in Pisces is a natural psychedelic trip.</p>

<h4>19/9/22</h4>

<p>-"The first known account of the production of the homunculus is said to be found in an undated Arabic work called the Book of the Cow , purportedly written by the Greek philosopher Plato himself. The materials required for the creation of the homunculus include human semen, a cow or ewe and animal blood, whilst the process includes the artificial insemination of the cow / ewe, smearing the inseminated animal’s genitals with the blood of another animal, and feeding it exclusively on the blood of another animal. The pregnant animal would eventually give birth to an unformed substance, which would then be places in a powder made of ground sunstone (a mystical phosphorescent elixir), sulphur, magnet, green tutia (a sulphate of iron) and the sap of a white willow. When the blob starts growing human skin, it would be required to be placed in a large glass or lead container for three days. After that, it has to be fed with the blood of its decapitated mother for seven days before becoming a fully-formed homunculus.</p>

<p>The 16th century alchemist, Philip von Hohenheim, known also as Paracelsus, provides a different recipe for creating the homunculus in his work, De Natura Rerum . This recipe uses a horse as the surrogate mother of the homunculus, and the semen of a man is left inside the animal’s womb to putrefy for forty days, before a little man is born."</p>
<br>
<p>The womb was thought to be a warm, fleshy nutrient rich container.</p>
<br>
<p>There are ideas of mixing semen and raw meat, heating it in a vessel to make a child or childlike creature. Soil is a womb, a nutrient and water sponge. Nutrient maybe being blood.</p>
<br>

<p>Ground yourself when doing magic. That stops the backlashes.</p>
<br>
<p>Life was simpler back in the day and you learned to navigate it and society quicker. Today it is slower, more complex to gain proficiency within it. So perhaps having children is delayed.</p>
<br>
<p>Bad spirits seem to get stuck in the nerves. Usually during shortings of the nerves, exhaustion and over use or stress of them. This is related to possession.</p>
<br>
<h4>28/9/22</h4>

<p>A world where we dedicate all of our energies to work is unnatural but it is required in order to get a house and other necessities in todays world.</p>
<br>
<p>Kinda fucked up that we've all been turned into slaves of the system for some rich “Individuals” who control it.</p>
<br>
<p>Women want to help immigrants, pests and strays because it stimulates their nurturing instincts.</p>
