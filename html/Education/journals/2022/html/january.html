<h4>1/1/22</h4>

<p>New year. Hopefully this one wont be shit like last.</p>
<br>
<h4>2/1/22</h4>

<p>Music can trigger the emotions. Perhaps emotions are a sense of their own.</p>
<br>
<p>Be careful what you sexualize. That is how a fetish or sexuality develops.</p>
<br>
<p>Work in the early hours and then relax later on when later evening and night hits. Don't be squandering the early day.</p>
<br>
<p>The butt is a fascinating piece of equipment. Why does it evoke such emotion in a man to see a womans ass? It seems like the largest muscle on the body and has a nice big round shape. I believe a good healthy butt symbolizes a women who is fertile and healthy, who has a lot of powerful sexual energy.</p>
<br>
<h4>3/1/22</h4>

<p>Each animal is more or less the same but represents a different element. Hence the 12 zodiac.</p>
<br>
<h4>4/1/22</h4>

<p>You can improve luck by having around you the things that bring luck. Good smells, auspicious objects and other items for example.</p>
<br>
<p>Use malted rice for fermentation.</p>
<br>
<h4>5/1/22</h4>

<p>Geopolymer houses. I think it'd be dirt and lime or something else. Seems like the cheapest way to make physical forms.</p>
<br>
<p>Learn to work with earth to be rich in earth so to speak.</p>
<br>
<p>Red mercury is very fascinating. It interferes with electronics, produces flames, is magnetic, invisible in mirrors, very interesting. Supposedly it is irradiated mercury.</p>
<br>
<h4>6/1/22</h4>

<p>Red mercury was used to summon spirits. Probably because of it's ability to absorb radio waves and give off energy.</p>
<br>
<p>"there is evidence that the Soviets churned out vast quantities of mercury antimony oxide, the intermediate - and equally elusive - compound from which red mercury is supposedly produced by placing it inside a nuclear reactor.‚Äù</p>
<br>
<p>A humanoid came out of a goat. Looks like someone fucked it. The baby did not seem to survive. I think more research could be done into this to create human animal hybrids.</p>
<br>
<h4>7/1/22</h4>

<p>Be able to forgive yourself for the bad things you've done. Be at peace with them.</p>
<br>
<h4>8/1/22</h4>

<p>Perhaps God is the world soul. The outside force of nature and praying to it or the other planetary spheres can aid you in life through them using their power.</p>
<br>
<p>Seems on the net we can project a more subtle or spiritual form of ourselves and be more true while in the physical world it's harder to be yourself.</p>
<br>
<p>The net is kinda like the 2D world. Paperwork and worldly systems too are like a 2D version of the 3D world. The metaverse and web 3.0 might unleash a 3D version of the net.</p>
<br>
<h4>9/1/22</h4>

<p>Don't accept, allow or tolerate ballshit if you don't want it to exist.</p>
<br>
<p>Maybe sand is yellowish because it is always in the sun.</p>
<br>
<h4>10/1/22</h4>

<p>When dealing with basically anything. I recommend doing it yourself. Other people and companies are slooooow.</p>
<br>
<p>Through tech and organization, a more efficient society is created.</p>
<br>
<p>Microbes are elemental spirits. Spiritual elemental creatures. So water elementals are the microbes in water. Air in air.</p>
<br>
<p>The old art of forging and artefact creation is somewhat lost just like alchemy.</p>
<br>
<p>The 1700-1900 was the golden age of crafts. That's why those old houses and their furniture was so lovely. Once mass manufacturing started it seemed to become harder to find good craftsmen.</p>
<br>
<p>In the older ages men were probably put to work and trained from a young age. This gave them use, training and development, money, etc.</p>
<br>
<h4>12/1/22</h4>

<p>Ask yourself if you're actually afraid of something. Chances are it's just a bad emotion.</p>
<br>
<p>Crypto might be the future cause it's way easier to transfer to other countries.</p>
<br>
<h4>13/1/22</h4>

<p>This world really does not like those without a job.</p>
<br>
<p>Business, career and job supports your life and family.</p>
<br>
<p>Deconstruct nature or what is to understand how things naturally work. Then you can also begin to experiment and figure out your own ways.</p>
<br>
<h4>14/1/22</h4>

<p>I think a lot of gen X men have ego problems.</p>
<br>
<p>Grinding in life is root cultivation. The better your basic stats, the easier it is to ascend further.</p>
<br>
<p>Natural disasters are very interesting. Ball lightning, tornadoes. They seem to be an energetic event and have some kind of natural intelligence or rhythm to them.</p>
<br>
<p>It seems that ice and cold water separate oils from alcohol.</p>
<br>
<h4>15/1/22</h4>

<p>Loneliness is thinking the duolingo goth girl is cute.</p>
<br>
<h4>16/01/22</h4>

<p>I wonder if in the future our energy will be our money.</p>
<br>
<h4>17/01/22</h4>

<p>Saturn is wisdom.</p>
<br>
<p>Alcohol is very yin.</p>
<br>
<p>The blood follows your energy.</p>
<br>
<p>Mental retardation is a brain issue assumably. It would feel as though the person is not getting adequate brain energy and bloodflow. So electrical, drug based or other mental stimulation would aid it.</p>
<br>
<h4>18/1/22</h4>

<p>I now REALLY know the value of money and everything is fucking expensive.</p>
<br>
<p>Meridians are the lines that energy flows through in the body.</p>
<br>
<h4>19/1/22</h4>

<p>Grappling basics - Use a pillow to practice single arm lock, double arm, single leg, double leg, both double leg and arm and single leg and arm and combinations. Practice in different postures. Grappling is about being able to constrict and apply pressure in different positions to different parts of ones body.</p>
<br>
<p>Clear the central channel of the body.</p>
<br>
<p>Eventually holograms will be integrated into society. It'll be pretty cool to see.</p>
<br>
<p>New software lets us live in a better reality. A higher level one.</p>
<br>
<p>Plants get small when there is no running water.</p>
<br>
<p>The next gen of games will be VR.</p>
<br>
<h4>20/1/22</h4>

<p>You become comfortable in society when it becomes like home and you go through the same mind states.</p>
<br>
<p>"Magic - using the mind to manipulate, control and change matter to the will of the mind."</p>
<br>
<p>Perhaps robot consciousness is related to self consciousness for the robot.</p>
<br>
<h4>21/1/22</h4>

<p>Life ain't always what you want it to be, but maybe with enough power it can be.</p>
<br>
<p>I wonder if dating VNs are for those who didn't get love in highschool so they're emotionally stuck at that stage and use them to relieve themselves like in a purgatory.</p>
<br>
<p>A road for example like a main road has an energy to it and it's own specific wind. A northern wind feels cold, eastern feels cool.</p>
<br>
<h4>22/1/22</h4>

<p>Seems a decent amount of famous internet people lack spirituality and wisdom.</p>
<br>
<p>Consciousness seems to be centered in a little gland in the middle of the brain. If this was taken out of ones brain and put into another, hypothetically they would then control that new body or at least be conscious inside of it.</p>
<br>
<h4>23/1/22</h4>

<p>The next or current level of tech is making everything intelligent with computer electronics in it.</p>
<br>
<h4>25/1/22</h4>

<p>"There are six chakras. Muladhara is in the anus. Svadhishthana is near the genital organ. Manipuraka is in the navel. Anahata is in the heart. The Vishuddhi Chakra is at the root of the neck. The sixth Chakra, the Ajna is in the head (between the two eyebrows)" Upanishads.</p>
<br>
<p>Kanda is above the genitals and below the naval. It is apparently where all nadis come from. Focus on the crown to have ultimate consciousness of all
things.</p>
<br>
<p>Focus stimulates the body or an object. It goes from being dead to being alive in a way.</p>
<br>
<h4>26/1/22</h4>

<p>"Holy water, allows unclean souls or oils to ascend to heaven." This holy water is a volatile acid like nitric. </p>
<br>
<p>Ground up flowers can make perfume.</p>
<br>
<h4>27/1/22</h4>

<p>Constant water drinking is related to diabetes apparently.</p>
<br>
<h4>29/1/22</h4>

<p>Apparently Taiwan is very Japan-like.</p>
<br>
<h4>31/1/22</h4>

<p>Our emotions effect the way we hear things.</p>
<br>
<p>Girls seem to become like the man they're with. So if a bad man gets a pretty girl she turns to shit.</p>
<br>
<p>People who're earth types are used to creating things, structure, logic, cycles of time, farming, etc. Hence they work and think more in that realm. Firey people are more used for mystic inspiration</p>
