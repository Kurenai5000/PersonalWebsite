<h4>1/8/22</h4>

<p>Angels and demons in you are the lower and higher centers. Jesus is the heart, God the mind and the devil the bowels.</p>
<br>
<h4>2/8/22</h4>

<p>Enjoy the hard times because those are when you truly learn. Enjoy the good times because they are without struggle.</p>
<br>
<h4>3/8/22</h4>

<p>Life energy comes from the earth. Figure out a way to up the voltage from the earth and use that.</p>
<br>
<p>I wonder if the other planets are portals to other worlds.</p>
<br>
<h4>6/8/22</h4>

<p>Tiktok or short vids are digital drugs.</p>
<br>
<h4>7/8/22</h4>

<p>Hypothetically when you volatilize a metal in a chamber and use EMF, you may be able to transmute it by adjusting the frequency.</p>
<br>
<p>The west is a price of living farm. They pull in immigrants with ideas of a better life and lots of money only for them to end up spending tons to live.</p>
<br>
<p>Countries go through a communist era to upgrade and then take on a more capitalistic approach.</p>
<br>
<p>Crude oil is a hydro carbon. So it's like both the earth and water element in one. Then water is another prime ingredient as is air and raw earth.</p>
<br>
<h4>8/8/22</h4>

<p>You can kinda see that most countries came from a single man or groups phenotype.</p>
<br>
<p>The back head chakra seems to relate to the throat.</p>
<br>
<p>Maybe hydrocarbon cracking uses silicon compounds because it mirrors what happens in the earth when oil heats and turns into other matters.</p>
<br>
<p>Stop thinking of chemistry in terms of molecules and atoms and more in terms of solids, liquids and gasses and then you will understand alchemy.</p>
<br>
<h4>14/8/22</h4>

<p>Maternal, mother, matter. Paternal, patron, father, pattern.</p>
<br>
<p>Matter and its pattern. Perhaps the structure and form of matter is related to its pattern.</p>
<br>
<p>Crystals can hold, receive and transmit natural spacial energy.</p>
<br>
<p>Apply more resistance to get higher amps.</p>
<br>
<p>More cells in series gets higher voltage and more in parallel gets more capacity.</p>
<br>
<h4>16/8/22</h4>

<p>Women, money, food. The three things which feed your lower self.</p>
<br>
<p>Battery is two metals, anode - / cathode + pieces and an electrolyte like lithium or sodium.</p>
<br>
<p>Men are up and down, women are left and right.</p>
<br>
<p>Anything moving and chaotic is a portal to the spirit world. Steam, smoke, white noise, fire, water to an extent.</p>
<br>
<h4>17/8/22</h4>

<p>On my pc I create the internet and spiritual world. On the web browser I access it, as a middle level.</p>
<br>
<h4>19/8/22</h4>

<p>Alkaloids are a spiritual salt.</p>
<br>
<h4>21/8/22</h4>

<p>Supposedly chemotherapy replaced mercury chloride and arsenic trioxide for use in cancer treatment.</p>
<br>
<h4>24/8/22</h4>

<p>High frequency sound waves can levitate objects.</p>
<br>
<h4>25/8/22</h4>

<p>The spine and brain is the sperm and body is the egg.</p>
<br>
<p>The testicles connect to the bladder and the penis connects to the prostate energetically.</p>
<br>
<p>The problems of today that the new adults face are different than those of the past.</p>
<br>
<p>In the past it might've been physical labor, farming, crafting, working jobs or some kind of business natured thing. Today it's more psychological, technological, quicker, much more internally painful.</p>
<br>
<p>We have to pave way for the future, take on this stress and weight in order to pioneer.</p>
<br>
<h4>28/8/22</h4>

<p>Clout chasing sells the soul, old spirituality harms the body.</p>
<br>
<p>Resurrecting the dead is possible I believe if their soul has not left the world but is still transitioning.</p>
<br>
<h4>29/8/22</h4>

<p>Water gives and takes life, it mediates life. Without water something is dry and dead, forever preserved. It is said life originated from a bacterial water soup.</p>
<br>
<h4>30/8/22</h4>

<p>Salt water and fresh water, from them created all things. The salt water is chaotic water and fresh the calm.</p>
<br>
<p>Lilith is Ereshkigal.</p>
<br>
<p>She is the moon or earth goddess.</p>
<br>
<p>Vigor is the mark of a man. The ability to do. The driving force.</p>
<br>
<h4>31/8/22</h4>

<p>Use the earth element to cure cuts or physical wounds.</p>
<br>
<p>Focus on the real elements and bring them alive. Focus on the real physical bodies-physical parts or real heat. The more real your magic becomes the more real it becomes.</p>
