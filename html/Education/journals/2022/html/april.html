<h4>2/4/22</h4>

<p>A man and or a family starts a city.</p>
<br>
<p>The art of getting fucking jacked.</p>
<br>
<h4>3/4/11</h4>

<p>The west is a country for the rich. It is based on individualism.</p>
<br>
<h4>4/4/22</h4>

<p>The west is a world for rich boomers.</p>
<br>
<p>Humans are like a mechanical animal creature with a ghost which is the mental form, an electrical cloud or figure which directs and guides the mechanical form.</p>
<br>
<p>-Spiritual energy turns reality from being purely physical to a more mental form. It is probably the energy of magic, what allows you to go beyond your physical form or also to control it.</p>

<p>Without spiritual energy, life is just a solid, physical form like ice. With too much spirit it is a dream like state. So to condense the spirit into matter, you relax and rest it. Do the opposite of stimulating it.</p>
<br>
<h4>6/4/22</h4>

<p>The value of women and houses or land is related as they are both yin.</p>
<br>
<p>Chinese language actually seems easier than Japanese in how you only need to learn one reading per character instead of 5 or so in Japanese.</p>
<br>
<h4>7/4/22</h4>

<p>Success is a flower born out of the dead soil of failure and experience.</p>
<br>
<p>Grinding up to max level in the world is a good first goal.</p>
<br>
<p>Wars are also fought on a mental level.</p>
<br>
<p>Light is another element like how air is. It's thinner than air.</p>
<br>
<p>The US's export is entertainment, social media.</p>
<br>
<p>You are a bone and meat machine controlled by an electro plasma ghost.</p>
<br>
<p>If you grind and mix two things well you combine them.</p>
<br>
<p>Karma is the impurities in the body. In one form at least.</p>
<br>
<h4>9/4/22</h4>

<p>Men of God probably keep their focus in the head-crown.</p>
<br>
<h4>11/4/22</h4>

<p>-Basis of income - Do things to make money. The more skills and the higher level they are the more money you can make. In the old days you could make money with basic resource accumulation like fishing, hunting, farming, woodcutting, herb collecting, etc.</p>

<p>Nowadays with the internet the game has changed more to high level skills. Maybe programming, video editing, writing, etc. The father is meant to teach the sons how to make money and survive in the world, what you can do. The mothers teach the daughters to be wives and to care for others.</p>
<br>
<h4>12/4/22</h4>

<p>Race is adaptation to different environments.</p>
<br>
<h4>13/4/22</h4>

<p>When you wanna make gainz then work out, when you wanna make money then work, when you wanna get better at tech stuff then do that.</p>
<br>
<p>Things are always changing. Be flexible and adaptable until you can go up a tier and see life from a higher dimension.</p>
<br>
<h4>16/4/22</h4>

<p>Earth and water formula- Dongquai, rehamnnia, astragalus, he shou, patchouli, seaweed, horsetail grass, dodder seed.</p>
<br>
<p>Zoomers are barred from reality. Millenials are the last generation to live in reality.</p>
<br>
<h4>17/4/22</h4>

<p>Whatever you can make yourself feel with magic is what you can make others feel.</p>
<br>
<p>Tonight the light rain and humidity brought down the industrial and factory smells at night while bright fluorescent lights lit up the sky. That is a romantic ambiance of the lower class.</p>
<br>
<h4>18/4/22</h4>

<p>I think programming and language learning is developing my mind and throat.</p>
<br>
<p>Care more for the mission than the reward.</p>
<br>
<h4>19/4/22</h4>

<p>There are no scary policeman, council man or FBI coming to get you. The problems you face and the threats you face will be from others around you in your area.</p>
<br>
<h4>20/4/22</h4>

<p>Types of geography, deserts, swamps, icy mountains, mountainy mountains, regular grassy planes, forests.</p>
<br>
<h4>23/4/22</h4>

<p>There are inner and outer doctors. Inner doctors of the modern age use drugs, outer use surgery. In the past, inner doctors used herbs and meditations and inner exercises while outer used massage, moxibustion, scraping, exercise, etc.</p>
<br>
<p>Womens power is through their beauty. Mans is through their strength.</p>
<br>
<h4>26/4/22</h4>

<p>The face tells you about the mind of someone. Judge someone based on their face and body.</p>
<br>
<p>When not expending energy, the internal gathers energy.</p>
<br>
<h4>27/4/22</h4>

<p>I hate the genX and boomer economy. I can't wait till everything is online, super fast and systematized.</p>
<br>
<h4>28/4/22</h4>

<p>I miss living in harmony with nature. We have lost that here in the west.</p>
<br>
<h4>29/4/22</h4>

<p>Three areas of a society. 1 - the lowest level of outer peasant houses, factories/manufacturing areas, farms. 2 - social society with towns, merchant areas, shops, craft areas. 3 - the highest area or level with priests, magicians, kings, queens, political figures and managerial types.</p>
<br>
<p>Supposedly a dog gained temporary consciousness from eating mushrooms. Perhaps then this is one way to give animals a higher consciousness.</p>
<br>
<p>Maybe a water center will give computers or electronics a kind of emotion. Maybe through mercury through.</p>
<br>
<h4>30/4/22</h4>

<p>Spiritual issues of intention and consciousness are at the top of the head while memory is at the back. Visual is the front, voice is the lower area, hearing at the sides and mental is inner.</p>
<br>
<p>Breathe to gain energy.</p>
