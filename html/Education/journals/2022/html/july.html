<h4>1/7/22</h4>

<p>Supposedly bacteria convert iron rock to oxide in lakes. This is interesting. I guess the older people said that it was elementals. I look at it more like a natural process, a natural change and the bacteria are only mediators.</p>
<br>
<h4>2/7/22</h4>

<p>Radioactive metals probably give free energy.</p>
<br>
<p>When it's cold my energy wants to go inside of me.</p>
<br>
<h4>4/7/22</h4>

<p>There's cold energy that builds up which is magnetic in the body or negative. This can be drawn out through medical arts. I think metal draws this energy up.</p>
<br>
<h4>5/7/22</h4>

<p>Taking a gland or organ fluid through tablets or other oral methods is not good long term. Short term it can stimulate the effected area but the main idea of healing is to heal and restore the organ/gland or area of the body to its natural state. Otherwise if they continually use the specified liquid of that part of the body, the original gland/organ will become weaker, smaller and non functional after a while of time.</p>
<br>
<h4>6/7/22</h4>

<p>Status is probably related to the heart. Wealth is the root, probably.</p>
<br>
<p>"The five Zhi (Ganoderma), Er Dan Sha (Cinnabar), Yu Zha(Nephritum), Ceng Qing (Azuritum), Xiong Huang (Realgar), Ci Huang (Auripigmentum), Yun Mu (Muscovitum), and Tai Yi Yu Yu Liang (Limonitum) can each be administered internally. They may enable the taker to fly and enjoy longevity." -Baopuzi, probably.</p>
<br>
<p>We can't allow degenerates to live in a good society or group because of the sympathetic resonance that they have, their influence on others.</p>
<br>
<h4>7/7/22</h4>

<p>Supposedly the throat center is the center of occultism. Poisons can collect here.</p>
<br>
<h4>9/7/22</h4>

<p>Maybe sublimating crystals makes them more open to their properties because the waters and oils will re run down the flask.</p>
<br>
<p>What you feel is what others feel. Empathy and sympathetic resonance between people The same way what we hear or see, we can feel from others emotions or read from their thoughts.</p>
<br>
<h4>10/7/22</h4>

<p>Heat is life, heat grows things.</p>
<br>
<p>The upper center is how well you understand and sense life, consciousness. The lower is how well you grow, physically am, have raw fuel to live in life.</p>
<br>
<h4>12/7/22</h4>

<p>More sand and bigger rocks in clay means more water can go through it. The earth has a moisture flow in its physical parts just like our bodies do.</p>
<br>
<p>Just because of some little cracks or failures does not mean the whole thing is bad or lost. You just need to accept those and move on.</p>
<br>
<p>Through technology we are reaching infinity, a state where we can live in whatever world or do whatever thing we want. Technology will facilitate infinity, imagination into reality.</p>
<br>
<h4>13/7/22</h4>

<p>Oxi-jinn, Nitro-Jinn, Hydro-Jinn.</p>
<br>
<p>We went from music to podcasts.</p>
<br>
<p>Talking in this Aquarian age will be very powerful.</p>
<br>
<p>Programming will be like reading and writing in another 10-20 years.</p>
<br>
<h4>14/7/22</h4>
<br>
<p>Imagine stuff to sleep.</p>
<br>
<h4>16/7/22</h4>

<p>The warrior goes in, kills everyone and takes over the castle.</p>
<br>
<p>Substance might be a word for both matter and energy.</p>
<br>
<h4>17/7/22</h4>

<p>First clear out the internal organs bad energy, then the external body. Clear out the trauma and bad emotions and thoughts, feelings.</p>
<br>
<p>Mothers want you educated, fathers want you to make money.</p>
<br>
<h4>18/7/22</h4>

<p>"Geography is the visible condensation of time." Terrence Mckenna.</p>
<br>
<p>"Language is the most etherialized and present form of time." Terrence Mckenna.</p>
<br>
<p>Perhaps psychedelics are hyper aetheric drugs. Hence why they remove you so much from earth.</p>
<br>
<p>Society is fathers land where women rule, created by men. Nature is the mothers land where men rule, created by the feminine.</p>
<br>
<p>The spirit vein is probably the spine.</p>
<br>
<p>Parsley is used for autism. It is a mercurial herb. Then perhaps autism is a throat/mercury disorder.</p>
<br>
<h4>19/7/22</h4>

<p>I wonder if solar panels are electrically conductive crystals that draw energy from light.</p>
<br>
<h4>20/7/22</h4>

<p>Thin resin with alcohol to make a thinner coat.</p>
<br>
<h4>23/7/22</h4>

<p>Potentially the north pole needs to warm for us to get out of the ice age. Perhaps the evil in the world want an eternal ice age and Atlantis or the true north might warm and unleash magic upon the world again.</p>
<br>
<p>Supposedly Egypt and the middle east was more moist and had greenery. So then perhaps the sun was more upwards and those areas were cooler.</p>
<br>
<p>The annunaki are probably north pole white people who migrated down and then interbred with the lower races. They used them to mine gold and build great structures. </p>
<br>
<p>When the inner body is full, circulate out to the limbs.</p>
<br>
<h4>24/7/22</h4>

<p>Minerals or powders and grease makes crude makeup or body paint.</p>
<br>
<h4>25/7/22</h4>

<p>The next engine will probably be a micro fusion or nuclear engine/reactor that makes electricity, perhaps. That power will be used for the next motor that converts electricity or some kind of radiant power into movement/thrust.</p>
<br>
<p>Engines and motors, from hand powered to solid fuel, liquid, gas then electrical.</p>
<br>
<p>High voltage plasma lifters is how you convert electricity into thrust. Add a cone or some kind of air thingo or a bell that uses high voltage and then you have an electrical thruster.</p>
<br>
<h4>29/7/22</h4>

<p>Were historical aliens just hyper advanced northerners?</p>
<br>
<p>Methane is sublimated shit.</p>
<br>
<h4>30/7/22</h4>

<p>Lead paint keeps out emf.</p>
<br>
<p>-Hierarchy of money and how it effects your life - First stage is poverty, under the poverty line where you just focus on survival, food, water, shelter. Second is pleasure where you focus on relaxing a bit and having some fun with your money.</p>

<p>Third of the yellow chakra is ego purchases. This is where you buy a pc, car, tv, luxury items, clothes, etc. This can help to further your ego, looks and work ability. Tools for example would fit here. Third is the heart chakra of friends and family. This is when you can start to date, have friends, be with family and enjoy people.</p>

<p>Fourth I think of the throat is travel, starting to teach. This is where you start to draw in energy from the world around you because of your experience, reputation, money, etc. Fifth perhaps is the mind where you can enjoy more thinking time, maybe delve into research and education, start to take risks, even start a company. This is also creation, science.</p>

<p>Sixth the final head chakra is of being a king, making an empire, owning a country, space travel, inter dimensional stuff and higher level spiritual stuff. At this point the universe pays you to exist because you are such a divine, high level entity. The back of the head is the moon, the subconscious. It reflects the dark inner thoughts and vision. The imaginary world is that of the mind, third eye level. Energy or aetheric plane is that of the throat. The blue staticky stuff and intention is the pure focus of mind and force.</p>
<br>
<p>-The sand taken from dirt or clay is regular sand. Some kind of silica and insoluble rocks. Perhaps this helps to make the clay more divided and lets water pass through or is a byproduct of the regions dirt.</p>

<p>Shit from animals or compost could act as an organic clay or organically processed materials and waste. Hence does that mean that shit and clay or decaying organic matters is a form of prime material? Rock forms into smaller rocks like sand with water then sand forms into clay with more water application. Then this clay forms into dirt, dirt into organic matter like plants, moss, etc.</p>

<p>This is all aided by bacteria which is natures intermediaries. The organic plant matter somehow forms into animals and animals create spiritual life forms. Bacteria might be the intermediary between the elements. Water and grain, in between is the yeast which forms the alcohol, a new higher spiritual component to the mixture. Also temperature.</p>
