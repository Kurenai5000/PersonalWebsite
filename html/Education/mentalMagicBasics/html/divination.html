 <p>How does divination work? First, you must understand the whole universe, the world entirely. Its cycles, systems, laws and physics. From there we make simple patterns, the archetypes spoken about in the previous chapter of astrology. Everything divides into these archetypes or primary forms. Divination is learning to see the pattern in something and relate it to the desired wisdom being divined, at least one form is.</p>

 <p>Randomness is a key factor in divination. Randomness taps you into chaos, this is perhaps close to God in a way. Fire, water, wind and physical materials are used to divine. Each possessing a certain amount of randomness. Cards are shuffled, runes are scattered to give dead matter randomness, but the patterns in fire or water or the sounds of air can tell you what you may want to know.</p>

 <h3>How do you do it?</h3>
 <p>Functionally divination works by you thinking of the question, person, energy or whatever that you want to divine and gain knowledge or feelings on. Then shuffle your cards, or focus in your imagination and other senses, however you are trying to access this via a tool or not. Then read the signs that are given.</p>

 <h3>Tools</h3>
 <p>Tools are great to learn, I recommend tarot cards. Otherwise a yes/no coin, numbers or even making your own. Through modern software and websites we can also use computers perform divinations.</p>

 <p>Buy them or make them, as long as your tools represent primary archetypes. Numbers 0 through 9 or 10 each represent an archetype. 1 being the beginning, 0 as nothing, 9 as the end for example and 5 in the middle.</p>

 <h3>Mental divination</h3>
 <p>For mental divination you will want to focus within your mid head to stimulate the imagination. Focus on what you want to know/divine while also holding focus within your head. Play around to get it working.</p>
 
 <h3>Diving spell, accessing true wisdom</h3>
 <p>The divining spell is like channeling wisdom straight into your brain. You send a strong energetic force to the top and middle of your head while focusing on the idea of what you want to know. It is exhausting if a lot of energy is used, but some questions require a cost.</p>
