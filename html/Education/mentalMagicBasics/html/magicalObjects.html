 <p>First, you may notice that by doing these practices you start to see strange electrical like light around you or where you focus, in your room, etc. This light is magical in nature. It appears when you use magic, where natural mana is concentrated and during times like in between 3am to 6am it is strongest in a room.
It exists as a part of the "space" element, potentially an electromagnetic phenomena. Sometimes little sparks of light appear in this realm or field of reality when others think of you, like a worm-hole through space. This is a type of "spirit".</p>

 <h3>On Objects</h3>

 <p>Different materials have different magical properties. This can be explained through a more physical manner like how different woods smell differently, hence creating different effects on you when you smell them. But we're more interested in the pure "Magical radiation" that all objects have. You can think that similarly how all objects have temperatures or are effected by temperature, they're also effected by the magical element, spacial mana. Crystals and pure metals are good objects of practice for understanding this.</p>

 <p>If you want a practice then gather a few different kinds of crystals infront of you. If you don't have crystals then gather some kinds of objects with different materials.</p>

<p>Begin by closing your eyes and feeling your aura, like in exercise 1 of the elemental exercise section. Hold one of the crystals infront of you and cover it with  your mental aura. Connect with the object, feel its weight and spacial area. See if there's any difference in your aura. The flow of it, temperature, size, feeling, etc. Feel if there's a difference in the aura that is covering the crystal in your hand. Now pick up another crystal and do the same exercise. See if it feels energetically differently than the last crystal.</p>

<p>Another exercise is to test the energy storage capability of objects. Crystals seem to hold the most I find. Hold a crystal and channel energy into it by feeling a flow or movement into the crystal. Keep doing this until it feels like the crystal is rejecting your energy. You can keep trying to compress energy into it if you want. Otherwise, try to draw out energy from the stone, feel as if you're pulling from the object within your hand and store it back into your body.</p>

<p>This is a simple exercise to feel objects energy and see how it effects your own. As always, practice lots.</p>
