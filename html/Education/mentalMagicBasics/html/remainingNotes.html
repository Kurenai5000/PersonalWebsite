 <p>The spell list is a small list of spells and should be used to help inspire your own creation of spells. Similar concepts and ideas can be replicated.</p>

 <p>Gaining more magic power takes many years. It is generally a slow process but regular practice helps as magical ability relates to both the control of mana and the manipulation of it.</p>

 <p>Magic is well partnered with energy cultivation and alchemical work.</p>

 <p>Practicing with or against others is a good way to test how "real" and tangible your powers are.</p>

 <p>Avoid garlic, excessive iron, spicy foods, drugs, alcohol, caffeine or stimulants as these can effect your energy and make it harder to concentrate or perform magic.</p>

 <p>If male, avoid excessive masturbation and sex or learn how to control your ejaculation during sex. Woman should be mindful of their sexual fluids as well as moon cycle and notice when they're loosing energy.</p>

 <p>Areas that break concentration should be avoided. Dirty or broken houses, areas with excessive iron, bad smells, bad forces, etc.</p>

 <p>Certain people as well should be avoided as you may start to notice their aura and pick it up or it could interfere with your magic.</p>

 <p>Make sure to purify your self magically before casting a spell as you don't want bad emotions, feelings or thoughts to interfere with your magic.</p>

 <p>Always, ALWAYS be careful what you wish for.</p>

 <p>Make sure to stop and learn how to control any excessive thoughts and feelings. They can start to have real magical effects once you get stronger. Similarly, you may notice how everyone naturally is cursing one another.</p>

 <h3>Closing Notes</h3>

<p>Hopefully this book has served you well and you're able to develop your magical ability and theory.</p>

<p>Just remember that continuous study and practice over many years will help you to understand this art. It is fairly different to the usually practices we're used to in mundane life so it may take some time to understand. Though, just keep at it and you'll be able to do it.</p>
