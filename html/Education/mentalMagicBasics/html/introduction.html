<main class="centered margin3 largeText">
 <p>Magic is the manipulation of mana or in other words controlling etheric energy with your mind. We create phantom impressions in the imaginary world and densify them until they start to exist physically.</p>

 <p>This book can help to develop your imagination, to create an inner word, learn about etheric and other forms of energy and put them all to work in your favor.</p>

<p>The magical world is an electromagnetic dimension layed in with normal reality. This is where the internet, telephone and other radio wave technology works. It is a contrast or complement to the physical world where material objects exist.</p>

<p>These two worlds are in continuous communication as you will begin to see. Hence the harmony of mind and matter which is one key of magic.</p>
