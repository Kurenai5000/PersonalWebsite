 <p>These meditations and exercises are aimed at developing your magic center in the mid head. They can be done using the imaginary visual sense or with feeling. Both are useful. Doing these three activities will make it easier to use magic, imagine, have clearer senses, a stronger memory and other useful benefits for magic.</p>

 <p>1. First practice is to learn how to gather and compress mana in the head. It gives clarity of mind and creates a spiritual center in your mid head.</p>

 <p>Sit in a relaxed position. Breathe naturally and open up your body. Focus loosely in your mid head behind your eyes, half way in at the center of 
your brain. Don't overly tense or strain your mind. Start pulling into that center as if you have a vortex or a three dimensional vacuum cleaner, pulling in
energy with a light pressure. This is done through using your sense of feeling but you can also imagine blue light rushing in. While you're pulling in energy into this area, form a center or sphere with your sense of feeling or imaginary sight. It feels like a ball of light in your head. Continue this meditation for around 10 minutes.</p>

 <p>2. This meditation is very similar to the previous in that you sit, relax and perform it.</p>

 <p>Take the same posture as before and prepare yourself. Start focusing in the mid head center and simply meditate within this area. All you need to do is hold your focus here, not too strong or weakly. If you are training your visual imagination instead of tactile then imagine a blue glowing orb of light. Try to hold this for 10 minutes or more.</p>

 <p>3. Third meditation. </p>

 <p>Sit like the other ones and begin focusing in the mid head center. Similar to meditation 1, start exerting force or pressure from your mental center. It feels as if you're pushing outwards with your head into the room around you. Don't over exert yourself or use too much force. Visualize blue light expressing out if practicing visualization.</p>
