 <p>Just one word of advice. Always be careful what you wish for. ALWAYS.</p>

 <p>Now, how does this work and what is it? Essentially you're focusing on an intention that you want to bring into this world, a wish. It's heavily restricted by first astrology, second your own sphere of influence or what is "possible" already in your own life and third, your own mana and magical strength. If you lack the energy and way to direct it then don't expect much. If you want a million dollars and can't even make 10 on your own then don't complain when your spell gives you a low paying job. If the astrology, weather or your emotional, mental and physical state is off then you can accidentally manifest what you don't want or didn't expect.</p>

 <p>Start by figuring out what you want. You can be as specific or as loose as you want. The more specific, the more likely you get what you want but also it needs an equal exchange of energy so you may need to repeat the spell for a month to say, get enough money for a
car. If you're not very specific then you may only get a small push like a little bit of luck, maybe see an opportunity that you need to go for or some small happening equal to the energy you used.</p>

 <p>Next either write a summary on a talisman or use a symbol or hold the idea internally if you don't want to use external tools. After that it's simply a matter of powering or feeding the intention with your energy. So if it's a talisman, draw energy from your body into the talisman you're holding or looking at. If internal, visualize the intention as a sphere of light or simply tap into the feeling of what you want and then hold your focus on it, flowing energy into it. Continue this for about 3-5 minutes or however long you want and repeat it every day until you get the results you want or find that it's unachievable.</p>
