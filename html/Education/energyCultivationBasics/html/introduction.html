 <p>Energy cultivation is the gathering, condensing, externalizing and use of energy, usually in the body. This energy is also the same which nature uses. It exists as a pure state and then is split into two forces of yin and yang or positive and negative. Take for example the temperature of day and night, these are two examples of positive and negative energy.</p>

<p>Energy sustains and develops us. It allows us to evolve, to grow, to heal and to hurt. Those who have this energy gain success in life and the natural respect and love of others while those without it are ridiculed, hated and unseen.</p>

<p>This energy runs along channels in the body and nourishes the blood, bones, organs and muscles. It's different elements is what makes people look different and feel differently. </p>

<p>Supposedly it is the force which can allow for one to fly, move objects, create pressure and vibration, heat water and perform other miracles.(Postnote - Radio waves)</p>

<p>This is one of the ultimate arts.</p>
