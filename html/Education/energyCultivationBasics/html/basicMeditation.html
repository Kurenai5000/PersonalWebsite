 <p>To learn meditation, you first need to learn how to sit, breathe and focus. But also the absence of these. So first we'll learn the three basics and then the absence.</p>

 <h3>Sitting Meditation</h3>

 <p>Choose a location and position to sit in. I think that sitting without a backing, so on a padded floor is the best and most effective, though you can also sit on a chair, do it at your desk or on a couch if you're a beginner.</p>

 <p>Now all you need to do is sit, and focus on sitting. Relax, but don't slouch or completely let go. Just sit. Do this for 5-10 minutes. Continue to practice this and extend the time to train your ability to sit. Relax the blood vessels in the legs to keep them flowing properly.</p>

 <h3>Breathing Meditation</h3>

 <p>Now it's time to perfect your breathing.</p>

 <p>Sit in your meditation posture and start to focus on breathing. Take full breaths, in and out. Don't strain or your lungs will start to hurt. Just do it deeply and calmly, not too much, not too little. Focus inside of your naval or belly region. Breathe down into that region and open it up to allow your lungs to expand.</p>

 <p>Continue this practice for 5-10 minutes.</p>

 <h3>Focus Meditation</h3>

 <p>Assume your meditation posture. Start to focus lightly within the mid center region of your head. This is the third eye chakra or dan tien, mid head center. It's located between the eyes and inward to the center of your brain. Focusing here will give you perfect focus.</p>

 <p>Continue this practice for 5-10 minutes.</p>

 <h3>Void Meditation</h3>
 
 <p>Now you've learned how to train basic faculties to develop your meditative ability. Next is to learn void meditation, a very important meditation that allows you to clear your energy.</p> 

<p>Sit and be within relaxation, hold up your posture. Start to focus on nothing, just be. Don't try to do anything with your energy, breath or focus. Just be. If you can't stop yourself thinking then relax the mid head center and continue sitting.</p>

<p>Eventually you will enter a state of emptiness, a void state. This is a good meditation to open and close your other energy meditations that will be learned. It's also good to stop excessive nervous activity that can be caused from excess energy work, anxiety and stress.</p>
