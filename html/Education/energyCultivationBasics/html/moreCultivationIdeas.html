 <p>Here are some niche ideas to aid and enhance your meditations.</p>

 <h3>Use on Cultivation Drugs</h3>

 <p>Cultivation pills or drugs are commonly used to speed up and enhance meditation and physical training. There are many good recipes in Chinese manuals on mineral and herbal drugs for the kidneys, legs, qi drugs, yang drugs and yin drugs for example.</p>

 <p>You eat the drug, focus on your naval to digest it and then circulate the drugs effects all through your body and begin meditation.</p>

 <p>I have a few recipes in my alchemy book, but I will give you one of the best for cultivation.</p>

 <p>1 part Tribulus (Yang booster), 1 part Rehmannia (Yin and fluid booster), 1 part Peony root (Yin, blood tonic), 1 part Licorice root (Circulator), 1/4 part Ginseng (Qi tonic, circulator), 1/4 part Dongquai (Blood tonic)</p>

 <p>Use either as herbal pills made with honey or as a tea simmered for at least 30 minutes.</p>

 <h3>Special Meditation Rooms</h3>

<p>All materials resonate a special energy. Certain materials are more yin and others yang. Hence if you wish to create a special meditation room, use orgonite, crystals, minerals, put plants in there, have proper temperature, airflow and let it be made out of correct materials.</p>

 <h3>Partnered Meditation</h3>

 <p>Two people can meditate together back to back, sitting on one another or one person with their hands on the others upper back to direct energy into them. Sometimes meditation can be enhanced by doing this, but it can also be effected poorly if done with bad people.</p>

 <h3>Energy Sickness</h3>

 <p>You can get sick when reaching new levels, or training improperly by straining and overly tensing. Perform void meditation to alleviate this. Take some days off too if needed.</p>
