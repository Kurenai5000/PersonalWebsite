 <p>The natural flow of energy is that during day it rises and goes more externally through the body while  at night it sinks into the bones, organs and nerves while going lower.</p>

 <p>The central belly center is the center of the bodies energy. If you run focus through it, it will start to energize the kidneys and slowly spread throughout  the whole body, developing and energizing it.</p>

 <p>If you compress focus in an area, it will form a center. This can make it easier to perform energy cultivation in that specific area. Similarly you can continuously compress energy into the bones and muscles to strengthen them.</p>

 <p>Energy can heal you by directing it to wherever you're hurt. Usually larger injuries can take a while to heal as you may need to heal a lot of extra areas that surround the wound as the injury may have leaked out so to speak.</p>

 <p>You can externalize your energy by pushing your focus outside of the body. With practice you can learn to control it outside of you.</p>
