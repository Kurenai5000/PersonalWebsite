<h3>Societal Baseline</h3>
<p>Societal baseline important. If you are below this you do not fit into society and struggle getting anything/anywhere. Men below 35-40 are invisible.</p>
<p>The base is relative with age. early 20's base is 40, early 30s is probably 47, early 40s base around be 52ish. It doesn't rise much more than that.</p>

<h3>Societal Success</h3>
<p>Success for men doesn't really happen till around 70-80. Early 20's success point would be 55-60. 30's is 65-70.</p>
<p>Success means living a good life and not struggling with women, jobs, society, social situations, etc.</p>

<h3>Geography</h3>
<p>It also depends on geographical region. First world countries require an extra 10 or so points than a third world country.</p>
<p>You may notice this is not easy to satisfy. Wonder why you struggle in life? There you go. Society is demanding.</p>
